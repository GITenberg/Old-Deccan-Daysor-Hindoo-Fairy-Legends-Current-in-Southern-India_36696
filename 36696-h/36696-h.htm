<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> FEW words seem necessary regarding the origin of
these stories, in addition to what the Narrator says for
herself in her Narrative, and what is stated in the Collector&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Apology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the exception of two or three, which will be recognized
as substantially identical with stories of Pilpay or other
well-known Hindoo fabulists, I never before heard any of
these tales among the Mahrattas, in that part of the Deccan
where the Narrator and her family have lived for the last two
generations; and it is probable that most of the stories were
brought from among the Lingaets of Southern India, the tribe,
or rather sect, to which Anna de Souza tells us her family
belonged before their conversion to Christianity.</p>

<p>The Lingaets form one of the most strongly marked divisions
of the Hindoo races south of the river Kistna. They
are generally a well-favored, well-to-do people, noticeable for
their superior frugality, intelligence and industry, and for the
way in which they combine and act together as a separate
body apart from other Hindoos. They have many peculiarities
of costume, of social ceremony and of religion, which
strike even a casual observer; and though clearly not aboriginal,
they seem to have much ground for their claim to
belong to a more ancient race and an earlier wave of immigration
than most of the Hindoo nations with which they are
now intermingled.</p>

<p>The country they inhabit is tolerably familiar to most
English readers on Indian subjects, for it is the theatre of
many of the events described in the great Duke&rsquo;s earlier despatches,
and in the writings of Munro, of Wilkes, and of Buchanan.
The extraordinary beauty of some of the natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
features of the coast scenery, and the abundance of the architectural
and other remains of powerful and highly civilized
Hindoo dynasties, have attracted the attention of tourists and
antiquaries, though not to the extent their intrinsic merit
deserves. Some knowledge of the land tenures and agriculture
of the country is accessible to readers of Indian blue-books.</p>

<p>But of all that relates to the ancient history and politics
of the former Hindoo sovereigns of these regions very little is
known to the general reader, though from their power, and
riches and long-sustained civilization, as proved by the monuments
these rulers have left behind them there are few parts
of India better worth the attention of the historian and
antiquary.</p>

<p>Of the inner life of the people, past or present, of their
social peculiarities and popular beliefs, even less is known
or procurable in any published form. With the exception of
a few graphic and characteristic notices of shrewd observers
like Munro, little regarding them is to be found in the
writings of any author likely to come in the way of ordinary
readers.</p>

<p>But this is not from want of materials: a good deal has
been published in India, though, with the common fate of
Indian publications, the books containing the information are
often rare in English collections, and difficult to meet with in
England, except in a few public libraries. Of unpublished
material there must be a vast amount, collected not only by
the government servants, but by missionaries, and others
residing in the country, who have peculiar opportunities for
observation, and for collecting information not readily to be
obtained by a stranger or an official. Collections of this kind
are specially desirable as regards the popular non-Brahminical
superstitions of the lower orders.</p>

<p>Few, even of those who have lived many years in India
and made some inquiry regarding the external religion of its
inhabitants, are aware how little the popular belief of the
lower classes has in common with the Hindooism of the
Brahmins, and how much it differs in different provinces, and
in different races and classes in the same province.</p>

<p>In the immediate vicinity of Poona, where Brahminism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
seems so orthodox and powerful, a very little observation will
satisfy the inquirer that the favorite objects of popular worship
do not always belong to the regular Hindoo Pantheon.
No orthodox Hindoo deity is so popular in the Poona Deccan
as the deified sage Vithoba and his earlier expounders,
both sage and followers being purely local divinities. Wherever
a few of the pastoral tribes are settled, there Byroba, the
god of the herdsmen, or Kundoba, the deified hero of the
shepherds, supersedes all other popular idols. Byroba the
Terrible, and other remnants of Fetish or of Snake-worship,
everywhere divide the homage of the lower castes with the
recognized Hindoo divinities, while outside almost every village
the circle of large stones sacred to Vetal, the demon-god
of the outcast helot races, which reminds the traveler of the
Druid circles of the northern nations, has for ages held, and
still holds, its ground against all Brahminical innovations.</p>

<p>Some of these local or tribal divinities, when their worshipers
are very numerous or powerful, have been adopted
into the Hindoo Olympus as incarnations or manifestations
of this or that orthodox divinity, and one or two have been
provided with elaborate written legends connecting them with
some known Puranic character or event; but, in general, the
true history of the local deity, if it survives at all, is to be
found only in popular tradition; and it thus becomes a matter
of some ethnological and historical importance to secure all
such fleeting remnants of ancient superstition before they are
forgotten as civilization advances.</p>

<p>Some information of this kind is to be gleaned even from
the present series of legends, though the object of the collector
being simply amusement, and not antiquarian research,
any light which is thrown on the popular superstitions of the
country is only incidental.</p>

<p>Of the superhuman personages who appear in them, the
&ldquo;Rakshas&rdquo; is the most prominent. This being has many
features in common with the demoniacal Ogre of other lands.
The giant bulk and terrible teeth of his usual form are the
universal attributes of his congener. His habit of feasting on
dead bodies will remind the reader of the Arabian Ghoul,
while the simplicity and stupidity which qualify the supernatural
powers of the Rakshas, and usually enable the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
quick-witted mortal to gain the victory over him, will recall many
humorous passages in which giants figure in our own Norse
and Teutonic legends.</p>

<p>The English reader must bear in mind that in India beings
of this or of very similar nature are not mere traditions of the
past, but that they form an important part of the existing
practical belief of the lower orders. Grown men will sometimes
refuse every inducement to pass at night near the supposed
haunt of a Rakshas, and I have heard the cries of a
belated traveler calling for help attributed to a Rakshas luring
his prey.</p>

<p>Nor is darkness always an element in this superstition:
I have known a bold and experienced tracker of game
gravely assert that some figures which he had been for some
time keenly scanning on the bare summit of a distant hill
were beings of this order, and he was very indignant at the
laugh which his observation provoked from his less-experienced
European disciple. &ldquo;If your telescope could see as
far as my old eyes,&rdquo; the veteran said, &ldquo;or if you knew the
movements of all the animals of this hunting-ground as well
as I do, you would see that those must be demons and
nothing else. No men nor animals at this time of day would
collect on an open space and move about in that way. Besides,
that large rock close by them is a noted place for
demons; every child in the village knows that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have heard another man of the same class, when asked
why he looked so intently at a human footstep in the forest
pathway, gravely observed that the footmark looked as if the
foot which made it had been walking heel-foremost, and must
therefore have been made by a Rakshas, &ldquo;for they always
walked so when in human form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another expressed particular dread of a human face, the
eyes of which were placed at an exaggerated angle to each
other, like those of a Chinese or Malay, &ldquo;because that position
of the eyes was the only way in which you could recognize
a Rakshas in human shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the more advanced and populous parts of the country
the Rakshas seems giving way to the &ldquo;Bhoot,&rdquo; which more
nearly resembles the mere ghost of modern European superstition;
but even in this diluted form such beings have an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
influence over Indian imaginations to which it is difficult in
these days to find any parallel in Europe.</p>

<p>I found, quite lately, a traditionary order in existence at
Government House, Dapoorie, near Poona, which directed
the native sentry on guard &ldquo;to present arms if a cat or dog,
jackal or goat, entered or left the house or crossed near his
beat&rdquo; during certain hours of the night, &ldquo;because it was the
ghost&rdquo; of a former governor, who was still remembered as
one of the best and kindest of men.</p>

<p>How or when the custom originated I could not learn,
but the order had been verbally handed on from one native
sergeant of the guard to another for many years, without
any doubts as to its propriety or authority, till it was accidentally
overheard by an European officer of the governor&rsquo;s
staff.</p>

<p>In the hills and deserts of Sind the belief in beings of this
order, as might be expected in a wild and desolate country,
is found strong and universal; there, however, the Rakshas
has changed his name to that of our old friend the &ldquo;Gin&rdquo; of
the Arabian Nights, and he has somewhat approximated in
character to the Pwcca or Puck of our own country. The
Gin of the Beelooch hills is wayward and often morose, but
not necessarily malignant. His usual form is that of a
dwarfish human being, with large eyes and covered with long
hair, and apt to breathe with a heavy snoring kind of noise.
From the circumstantial accounts I have heard of such &ldquo;Gins&rdquo;
being seen seated on rocks at the side of lonely passes, I
suspect that the great horned eagle-owl, which is not uncommon
in the hill-country of Sind, has to answer for many well-vouched
cases of Gin apparition.</p>

<p>The Gin does not, however, always retain his own shape;
he frequently changes to the form of a camel, goat or other
animal. If a Gin be accidentally met, it is recommended
that the traveler should show no sign of fear, and, above all,
keep a civil tongue in his head, for the demon has a special
aversion to bad language. Every Beelooch has heard of instances
in which such chance acquaintanceships with Gins
have not only led to no mischief, but been the source of much
benefit to the fortunate mortal who had the courage and prudence
to turn them to account; for a Gin once attached to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
man will work hard and faithfully for him, and sometimes
show him the entrance to those great subterranean caverns
under the hills, where there is perpetual spring, and trees
laden with fruits of gold and precious stones; but the mortal
once admitted to such a paradise is never allowed to leave it.
There are few neighborhoods in the Beelooch hills which
cannot show huge stones, apparently intended for building,
which have been, &ldquo;as all the country-side knows,&rdquo; moved by
such agency, and the entrance to the magic cavern is never
very far off, though the boldest Beelooch is seldom very willing
to show or to seek for the exact spot.</p>

<p>Superstitions nearly identical were still current within the
last forty years, when I was a boy, on the borders of Wales.
In Cwm Pwcca (the Fairies&rsquo; Glen), in the valley of the
Clydach, between Abergavenny and Merthyr, the cave used
to be shown into which a belated miner was decoyed by the
Pwccas, and kept dancing for ten years; and a farm-house
on the banks of the Usk, not far off, was, in the last generation,
the abode of a farmer who had a friendly Pwcca in his
service. The goblin was called Pwcca Trwyn, as I was
assured from his occasionally being visible as a huge human
nose. He would help the mortal by carrying loads and
mending hedges, but usually worked only while the farmer
slept at noon, and always expected as his guerdon a portion
of the toast and ale which his friend had for dinner in the
field. If none was left for him, he would cease to work; and
he once roused the farmer from his noontide slumbers by
thrashing him soundly with his own hedging-stake.</p>

<p>The Peris or Fairies of these stories have nothing distinctive
about them. Like the fairies of other lands, they
often fall in love with mortal men, and are visible to the pure
eyes of childhood when hidden from the grosser vision of
maturer years.</p>

<p>Next to the Rakshas, the Cobra, or deadly hooded snake,
plays the most important part in these legends as a supernatural
personage. This is one only of the many traces
still extant of that serpent-worship formerly so general in
Western India. I have no doubt that Mr. Ferguson, in his
forthcoming work on Bhuddhist antiquities, will throw much
light on this curious subject. I will, therefore, only now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
observe that this serpent-worship as it still exists is something
more active than a mere popular superstition. The
Cobra, unless disturbed, rarely goes far from home, and is
supposed to watch jealously over a hidden treasure. He is
always, in the estimation of the lower classes, invested with
supernatural powers, and according to the treatment he receives
he builds up or destroys the fortunes of the house to
which he belongs. No native will willingly kill him if he can
get rid of him in any other way; and the poorer classes
always, after he is killed, give him all the honors of a regular
cremation, assuring him, with many protestations, as the pile
burns, &ldquo;that they are guiltless of his blood; that they slew
him by order of their master,&rdquo; or &ldquo;that they had no other
way to prevent his biting the children or the chickens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A very interesting discussion on the subject of the Snake
Race of Ancient India, between Mr. Bayley and Baboo Rajendralal
Mitr, will be found in the <i>Proceedings of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal</i>, for February, 1867.</p>

<h2>THE COLLECTOR&rsquo;S APOLOGY.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE collection of these legends was commenced with the
object of amusing a favorite young friend of mine. It
was continued, as they appeared in themselves curious illustrations
of Indian popular tradition, and in the hope that something
might thus be done to rescue them from the danger of
oral transmission.</p>

<p>Though varied in their imagery, the changes between the
different legends are rung upon very few themes, as if purposely
confined to what was most familiar to the people.
The similarity between the incidents in some of these and in
favorite European stories, particularly modern German ones,
is curious; and the leading characteristics peculiar to all
orthodox fairy tales are here preserved intact. Step-mothers
are always cruel, and step-sisters, their willing instruments;
giants and ogres always stupid; youngest daughters more
clever than their elder sisters; and the Jackal (like his European
cousin the Fox) usually overcomes every difficulty,
and proves a bright moral example of the success of wit
against brute force&mdash;the triumph of mind over matter.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that in the romances of a country where
women are generally supposed by us to be regarded as mere
slaves or intriguers, their influence (albeit most frequently
put to proof behind the scenes) should be made to appear so
great, and, as a rule, exerted wholly for good; and that, in a
land where despotism has such a firm hold on the hearts of
the people, the liberties of the subject should be so boldly
asserted as by the old Milkwoman to the Rajah in &ldquo;Little
Surya Bai,&rdquo; or the old Malee<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to the Rajah in &ldquo;Truth&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
Triumph;&rdquo; and few, probably would have expected to find the
Hindoos owning such a romance as &ldquo;Brave Seventee Bai;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
or to meet with such stories as &ldquo;The Valiant Chattee-maker,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Blind Man, the Deaf Man and the Donkey,&rdquo;
among a nation which, it has been constantly asserted, possesses
no humor, no sense of the ridiculous, and cannot
understand a joke.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;The Narrator&rsquo;s Narrative&rdquo; Anna Liberata de Souza&rsquo;s
own story is related, as much as possible, in her own words
of expressive but broken English. She did not, however,
tell it in one continuous narrative: it is the sum of many
conversations I had with her during the eighteen months that
she was with us.</p>

<p>The legends themselves are altered as little as possible:
half their charm, however, consisted in the Narrator&rsquo;s eager,
flexible voice and graphic gestures.</p>

<p>I often asked her if there were no stories of elephants
having done wonderful deeds (as from their strength and
sagacity one would have imagined them to possess all the
qualifications requisite to heroes of romance); but, strange
to say, she knew of none in which elephants played any part
whatsoever.</p>

<p>As regards the Oriental names, they have generally been
written as Anna pronounced them. It was frequently not
possible to give the true orthography, and the correctly spelt
name does not always give a clue to the popular pronunciation.
So with the interpretations and geography. Where it
is possible to identify what is described, an attempt has been
made to do so; but for other explanations Anna&rsquo;s is the sole
authority: she was quite sure that &ldquo;Seventee Bai&rdquo; meant
the &ldquo;Daisy Lady,&rdquo; though no botanist would acknowledge the
plant under that name; and she was satisfied that all gentlemen
who have traveled know where &ldquo;Agra Brum&rdquo; is, though
she had never been there, and no such province appears
in any ordinary Gazeteer or description of the city of
Akbar.</p>

<p>These few legends, told by one old woman to her grandchildren,
can only be considered as representatives of a class.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
&ldquo;That world,&rdquo; to use her own words, &ldquo;is gone;&rdquo; and those
who can tell us about it in this critical and unimaginative age
are fast disappearing too before the onward march of civilization;
yet there must be in the country many a rich gold mine
unexplored. Will no one go to the diggings?</p>

<h2>THE NARRATOR&rsquo;S NARRATIVE.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>Y grandfather&rsquo;s family were of the Lingaet caste, and
lived in Calicut; but they went and settled near Goa at
the time the English were there. It was there my grandfather
became a Christian. He and his wife, and all the family,
became Christians at once, and when his father heard it he was
very angry, and turned them all out of the house. There were
very few Christians in those days. Now you see Christians
everywhere, but then we were very proud to see one anywhere.
My grandfather was Havildar<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in the English army, and when
the English fought against Tippo Sahib, my grandmother followed
him all through the war. She was a very tall, fine,
handsome woman, and very strong; wherever the regiment
marched she went, on, on, on, on (great deal hard work that
old woman done). Plenty stories my granny used to tell about
Tippo and how Tippo was killed, and about Wellesley Sahib,
and Monro Sahib, and Malcolm Sahib, and Elphinstone Sahib.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Plenty things had that old woman heard and seen. Ah, he
was a good man, Elphinstone Sahib! My granny used often
to tell us how he would go down and say to the soldiers,
&ldquo;Baba,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Baba, fight well. Win the battles, and each man
shall have his cap full of money; and after the war is over I&rsquo;ll
send every one of you to his own home.&rdquo; (And he did do
it.) Then we children plenty proud, when we heard what
Elphinstone Sahib had said. In those days the soldiers were
not low-caste people like they are now. Many, very high-caste
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
men, and come from very far, from Goa, and Calicut, and
Malabar to join the English.</p>

<p>My father was a tent lascar,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and when the war was over
my grandfather had won five medals for all the good he had
done, and my father had three; and my father was given charge
of the Kirkee stores.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> My grandmother and mother, and all
the family, were in those woods behind Poona at time of the
battle at Kirkee.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I&rsquo;ve often heard my father say how full the
river was after the battle&mdash;baggage and bundles floating down,
and men trying to swim across&mdash;and horses and all such a
bustle. Many people got good things on that day. My father
got a large chattee,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and two good ponies that were in the
river, and he took them home to camp; but when he got there
the guard took them away. So all his trouble did him no
good.</p>

<p>We were poor people, but living was cheap, and we had
plenty comfort.</p>

<p>In those days house rent did not cost more than half a
rupee<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> a month, and you could build a very comfortable house
for a hundred rupees. Not such good houses as people now
live in, but well enough for people like us. Then a whole
family could live as comfortably on six or seven rupees a month
as they can now on thirty. Grain, now a rupee a pound, was
then two annas a pound. Common sugar, then one anna a
pound, is now worth four annas a pound. Oil which then sold
for six pice a bottle, now costs four annas. Four annas&rsquo; worth
of salt, chillies, tamarinds, onions and garlic, would then last a
family a whole month; now the same money would not buy a
week&rsquo;s supply. Such dungeree<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> as you now pay half rupee a
yard for, you could then buy from twenty to forty yards of, for
the rupee. You could not get such good calico then as now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
but the dungeree did very well. Beef then was a pice a pound,
and the vegetables cost a pie a day. For half a rupee you
could fill the house with wood. Water also was much cheaper.
You could then get a man to bring you two large skins full,
morning and evening, for a pie; now he would not do it under
half a rupee or more. If the children came crying for fruit, a
pie would get them as many guavas as they liked in the bazaar.
Now you&rsquo;d have to pay that for each guava. This shows how
much more money people need now than they did then.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The English fixed the rupee to the value of sixteen annas,
in those days there were some big annas, and some little ones,
and you could sometimes get twenty-two annas for a rupee.</p>

<p>I had seven brothers and one sister. Things were very
different in those days to what they are now. There were no
schools then to send the children to; it was only the great people
who could read and write. If a man was known to be able
to write he was plenty proud, and hundreds and hundreds of
people would come to him to write their letters. Now you find
a pen and ink in every house! I don&rsquo;t know what good all
this reading and writing does. My grandfather couldn&rsquo;t write,
and my father couldn&rsquo;t write, and they did very well; but all&rsquo;s
changed now.</p>

<p>My father used to be out all day at his work, and my
mother often went to do coolie-work,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and she had to take my
father his dinner (my mother did plenty work in the world);
and when my granny was strong enough she used sometimes
to go into the bazaar, if we wanted money, and grind rice for
the shop-keepers, and they gave her half a rupee for her day&rsquo;s
work, and used to let her have the bran and chaff besides.
But afterward she got too old to do that, and besides there
were so many of us children. So she used to stay at home
and look after us while my mother was at work. Plenty
bother &rsquo;tis to look after a lot of children. No sooner my
granny&rsquo;s back turned than we all run out in the sun, and play
with the dust and stones on the road.</p>

<p>Then my granny would call out to us, &ldquo;Come here, children,
out of the sun, and I&rsquo;ll tell you a story. Come in;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
you&rsquo;ll all get headaches.&rdquo; So she used to get us together
(there were nine of us, and great little fidgets, like all children),
into the house; and there she&rsquo;d sit on the floor, and
tell us one of the stories I tell you. But then she used to
make them last much longer, the different people telling their
own stories from the beginning as often as possible; so that
by the time she&rsquo;d got to the end, she had told the beginning
over five or six times. And so she went on, talk, talk, talk,
Mera Bap reh!<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Such a long time she&rsquo;d go on for, till all
the children got quite tired and fell asleep. Now there are
plenty schools to which to send the children, but there were
no schools when I was a young girl; and the old women,
who could do nothing else, used to tell them stories to keep
them out of mischief.</p>

<p>We used sometimes to ask my grandmother, &ldquo;Are those
stories you tell us really true? Were there ever such people
in the world?&rdquo; She generally answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but
maybe there are somewhere.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t believe there are any
of those people living; I dare say, however, they did once
live; but my granny believed more in those things than we
do now. She was a Christian, she worshiped God and believed
in our Saviour, but still she would always respect the
Hindoo temples. If she saw a red stone, or an image of
Gunputti<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> or any of the other Hindoo gods, she would kneel
down and say her prayers there, for she used to say, &ldquo;Maybe
there&rsquo;s something in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About all things she would tell us pretty stories&mdash;about
men, and animals, and trees, and flowers, and stars. There
was nothing she did not know some tale about. On the
bright cold-weather nights, when you can see more stars than
at any other time of the year, we used to like to watch the
sky, and she would show us the Hen and Chickens,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and the
Key,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and the Scorpion, and the Snake, and the Three Thieves
climbing up to rob the Ranee&rsquo;s silver bedstead, with their
mother (that twinkling star far away) watching for her sons&rsquo;
return. Pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, you can see how her heart beats,
for she is always frightened, thinking, &ldquo;Perhaps they will be
caught and hanged!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
Then she would show us the Cross,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> that reminds us of
our Saviour&rsquo;s, and the great pathway of light<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> on which He
went up to heaven. It is what you call the Milky Way.
My granny usen&rsquo;t to call it that: she used to say that when
our Lord returned up to heaven that was the way He went,
and that ever since it has shone in memory of His ascension,
so beautiful and bright.</p>

<p>She always said a star with a smoky tail (comet) meant
war, and she never saw a falling star without saying, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a great man died;&rdquo; but the fixed stars she used to think
were all really good people, burning like bright lamps before
God.</p>

<p>As to the moon, my granny used to say she&rsquo;s most useful
to debtors who can&rsquo;t pay their debts. Thus: A man who
borrows money he knows he cannot pay, takes the full moon
for witness and surety. Then, if any man so silly as to lend
him money and go and ask him for it, he can say, &ldquo;The
moon&rsquo;s my surety; go catch hold of the moon!&rdquo; Now, you
see, no man can do that; and what&rsquo;s more, when the moon&rsquo;s
once full, it grows every night less and less, and at last goes
out altogether.</p>

<p>All the Cobras in my grandmother&rsquo;s stories were seven-headed.
This puzzled us children, and we would say to her,
&ldquo;Granny, are there any seven-headed Cobras now? For all
the Cobras we see that the conjurors bring round have only
one head each.&rdquo; To which she used to answer, &ldquo;No, of
course there are no seven-headed Cobras now. That world
is gone, but you see each Cobra has a hood of skin; that is
the remains of another head.&rdquo; Then we would say, &ldquo;Although
none of those old seven-headed Cobras are alive now, maybe
there are some of their children living somewhere.&rdquo; But at
this my granny used to get vexed, and say, &ldquo;Nonsense! you
are silly little chatter-boxes; get along with you!&rdquo; And,
though we often looked for the seven-headed Cobras, we
never could find any of them.</p>

<p>My old granny lived till she was nearly a hundred; when
she got very old she rather lost her memory, and often made
mistakes in the stories she told us, telling a bit of one story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
and then joining on to it a bit of some other; for we children
bothered her too much about them, and sometimes she used
to get very tired of talking, and when we asked her for a
story, would answer, &ldquo;You must ask your mother about it;
she can tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah! those were happy days, and we had plenty ways to
amuse ourselves. I was very fond of pets; I had a little
dog that followed me everywhere, and played all sorts of
pretty tricks, and I and my youngest brother used to take
the little sparrows out of their nests on the roof of our
house and tame them. These little birds got so fond of me
they would always fly after me; as I was sweeping the floor
one would perch on my head, and two or three on my shoulders,
and the rest come fluttering after. But my poor father
and mother used to shake their heads at me when they saw
this, and say, &ldquo;Ah, naughty girl, to take the little birds out
of their nests: that stealing will bring you no good.&rdquo; All my
family were very fond of music. You know that Rosie (my
daughter) sings very nicely and plays upon the guitar, and
my son-in-law plays on the pianoforte and the fiddle (we&rsquo;ve
got two fiddles in our house now), but Mera Bap reh! how
well my grandfather sang! Sometimes of an evening he
would drink a little toddy,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and be quite cheerful, and sing
away; and all we children liked to hear him. I was very
fond of singing. I had a good voice when I was young, and
my father used to be so fond of making me sing, and I often
sang to him that Calicut song about the ships sailing on the
sea<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and the little wife watching for her husband to come
back, and plenty more that I forget now; and my father and
brothers would be so pleased at my singing, and laugh and
say, &ldquo;That girl can do anything.&rdquo; But now my voice is
gone, and I didn&rsquo;t care to sing any more since my son died,
and my heart been so sad.</p>

<p>In those days there were much fewer houses in Poona than
there are now, and many more wandering gipsies, and such
like. They were very troublesome, doing nothing but begging
and stealing, but people gave them all they wanted, as it was
believed that to incur their ill-will was very dangerous. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
was not safe even to speak harshly of them. I remember
one day, when I was quite a little girl, running along by my
mother&rsquo;s side, when she was on her way to the bazaar: we
happened to pass the huts of some of these people, and I
said to her &ldquo;See, mother, what nasty, dirty people those are;
they live in such ugly little houses, and they look as if they
never combed their hair nor washed.&rdquo; When I said this, my
mother turned round quite sharply and boxed my ears, saying,
&ldquo;Because God has given you a comfortable home and
good parents, is that any reason for you to laugh at others
who are poorer and less happy?&rdquo; &ldquo;I meant no harm,&rdquo; I
said; and when we got home I told my father what my mother
had done, and he said to her, &ldquo;Why did you slap the
child?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;If you want to know, ask your
daughter why I punished her. You will then be able to judge
whether I was right or not.&rdquo; So I told my father what I had
said about the gipsies, and when I told him, instead of pitying
me, he also boxed my ears very hard. So that was all I
got for telling tales against my mother!</p>

<p>But they both did it, fearing if I spoke evil of the gipsies
and were not instantly punished, some dreadful evil would
befall me.</p>

<p>It was after my granny that I was named &ldquo;Anna Liberata.&rdquo;
She died after my father, and when I was eleven years old.
Her eyes were quite bright, her hair black, and her teeth good
to the last. If I&rsquo;d been older then, I should have been able
to remember more of her stories. Such a number as she
used to tell! I&rsquo;m afraid my sister would not be able to
remember any of them. She has had much trouble; that
puts those sort of things out of people&rsquo;s heads; besides, she
is a goose. She is younger than I am, although you would
think her so much older, for her hair turned gray when she
was very young, while mine is quite black still. She is
almost bald too, now, as she pulled out her hair because it
was gray. I always said to her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do so; for you can&rsquo;t
make yourself any younger, and it is better, when you are
getting old, to look old. Then people will do whatever you
ask them! But however old you may be, if you look young,
they&rsquo;ll say to you, &lsquo;You are young enough and strong enough
to do your own work yourself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
My mother used to tell us stories too; but not so many
as my granny. A few years ago there might be found several
old people who knew those sorts of stories; but now children
go to school, and nobody thinks of remembering or telling
them&mdash;they&rsquo;ll soon be all forgotten. It is true there are
books with some stories something like these, but they always
put them down wrong. Sometimes when I cannot remember
a bit of a story, I ask some one about it; then they say,
&ldquo;There is a story of that name in my book. I don&rsquo;t know
it, but I&rsquo;ll read.&rdquo; Then they read it to me, but it is all wrong,
so that I get quite cross, and make them shut up the book.
For in the books they cut the stories quite short, and leave
out the prettiest part, and they jumble up the beginning of
one story with the end of another&mdash;so that it is altogether
wrong.</p>

<p>When I was young, old people used to be very fond of telling
these stories; but instead of that, it seems to me that now
the old people are fond of nothing but making money.</p>

<p>Then I was married. I was twelve years old then. Our
native people have a very happy life till we marry. The girls
live with their father and mother and brothers and sisters, and
have got nothing to do but amuse themselves, and got father
and mother to take care of them; but after they&rsquo;re married they
go to live at their husband&rsquo;s house, and the husband&rsquo;s mother
and sisters are often very unkind to them.</p>

<p>You English people can&rsquo;t understand that sort of thing.
When an Englishman marries, he goes to a new house, and his
wife is the mistress of it; but our native people are very different.
If the father is dead, the mother and unmarried sisters
live in the son&rsquo;s house, and rule it; his wife is nothing in
the house. And the mother and sisters say to the son&rsquo;s wife,
&ldquo;This is not your house&mdash;you&rsquo;ve not always lived in it; you
cannot be mistress here.&rdquo; And if the wife complains to her
husband, and he speaks about it, they say, &ldquo;Very well, if you
are such an unnatural son, you&rsquo;d better turn your mother and
sisters out of doors; but while we live here, we&rsquo;ll rule the
house.&rdquo; So there is always plenty fighting. It&rsquo;s not unkind
of the mother and sisters&mdash;it&rsquo;s custom.</p>

<p>My husband was a servant in Government House&mdash;that was
when Lord Clare was governor here. When I was twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
years old, my husband died of a bad fever, and left me with
two children&mdash;the boy and the girl, Rosie.</p>

<p>I had no money to keep them with, so I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to
service,&rdquo; and my mother-in-law said, &ldquo;How can you go with
two children, and so young, and knowing nothing?&rdquo; But I said,
&ldquo;I can learn, and I&rsquo;ll go;&rdquo; and a kind lady took me into her
service. When I went to my first place, I hardly knew a word
of English (though I knew our Calicut language, and Portuguese,
and Hindostani, and Mahratti well enough), and I could
not hold a needle. I was so stupid, like a Coolie-woman;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
but my mistress was very kind to me, and I soon learnt; she
did not mind the trouble of teaching me. I often think,
&ldquo;Where find such good Christian people in these days?&rdquo; To
take a poor, stupid woman and her two children into the
house&mdash;for I had them both with me, Rosie and the boy. I
was a sharp girl in those days; I did my mistress&rsquo; work and I
looked after the children too. I never left them to any one
else. If she wanted me for a long time, I used to bring the
children into the room and set them down on the floor, so as
to have them under my own eye whilst I did her work. My
mistress was very fond of Rosie, and used to teach her to
work and read. After some time my mistress went home,
and since then I have been in eight places.</p>

<p>My brother-in-law was valet at that time to Napier Sahib,
up in Sind. All the people and servants were very fond of
that Sahib. My brother-in-law was with him for ten years;
and he wanted me to go up there to get place as ayah, and
said, &ldquo;You quick, sharp girl, and know English very well;
you easily get good place and make plenty money.&rdquo; But I
such a foolish woman I would not go. I write and tell him,
&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t come, for Sind such a long way off, and I cannot
leave the children.&rdquo; I plenty proud then. I give up all for
the children. But now what good? I know your language.
What use? To blow the fire? I only a miserable woman,
fit to go to cook-room and cook the dinner. So go down in
the world, a poor woman (not much good to have plenty in
head and empty pocket!) but if I&rsquo;d been a man I might now
be a Fouzdar.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
I was at Kolapore<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> at the time of the mutiny, and we had
to run away in the middle of the night; but I&rsquo;ve told you before
all about that. Then seven years ago my mother died
(she was ninety when she died), and we came back to live at
Poona, and my daughter was married, and I was so happy and
pleased.</p>

<p>I gave a feast then to three hundred people, and we had
music and dancing, and my son, he so proud he dancing from
morning to night, and running here and there arranging everything;
and on that day I said, &ldquo;Throw the doors open, and
any beggar, any poor person come here, give them what they
like to eat, for whoever comes shall have enough, since there&rsquo;s
no more work for me in the world.&rdquo; So, thinking I should
be able to leave service, and give up work, I spent all the
money I had left. That was not very much, for in sending my
son to school I&rsquo;d spent a great deal. He was such a beauty
boy&mdash;tall, straight, handsome&mdash;and so clever. They used to
say he looked more like my brother than my son, and he said
to me, &ldquo;Mammy, you&rsquo;ve worked for us all your life; now I&rsquo;m
grown up, I&rsquo;ll get a clerk&rsquo;s place and work for you. You shall
work no more, but live in my house.&rdquo; But last year he was
drowned in the river. That was my great sad. Since then
I couldn&rsquo;t lift up my head. I can&rsquo;t remember things now as I
used to do, and all is muddled in my head, six and seven. It
makes me sad sometimes to hear you laughing and talking so
happy with your father and mother and all your family, when I
think of my father, and mother, and brothers, and husband,
and son, all dead and gone! No more happy home like that
for me. What should I care to live for? I would come to
England with you, for I know you would be good to me and
bury me when I die, but I cannot go so far from Rosie. My
one eye put out, my other eye left. I could not lose it too.
If it were not for Rosie and her children I should like to travel
about and see the world. There are four places I have always
wished to see&mdash;Calcutta, Madras, England and Jerusalem (my
poor mother always wished to see Jerusalem, too&mdash;that her
great hope); but I shall not see them now. Many ladies wanted
to take me to England with them, and if I had gone I should
have saved plenty money, but now it is too late to think of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
that. Besides, it would not be much use. What&rsquo;s the good
of my saving money? Can I take it away with me when I
die? My father and grandfather did not do so, and they had
enough to live on till they died. I have enough for what I
want, and I&rsquo;ve plenty poor relations. They all come to me,
asking for money, and I give it them. I thank our Saviour
there are enough good Christians here to give me a slice of
bread and cup of water when I can&rsquo;t work for it. I do not
fear to come to want.</p>

<h2>I.<br />
<br />
<i>PUNCHKIN.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there was a Rajah<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> who had
seven beautiful daughters. They were all good
girls; but the youngest, named Balna,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> was more
clever than the rest. The Rajah&rsquo;s wife died when
they were quite little children, so these seven poor
Princesses were left with no mother to take care of
them.</p>

<p>The Rajah&rsquo;s daughters took it by turns to cook their
father&rsquo;s dinner every day,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> whilst he was absent deliberating
with his ministers on the affairs of the nation.</p>

<p>About this time the Purdan<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> died, leaving a widow
and one daughter; and every day, every day, when
the seven Princesses were preparing their father&rsquo;s dinner,
the Purdan&rsquo;s widow and daughter would come
and beg for a little fire from the hearth. Then Balna
used to say to her sisters, &ldquo;Send that woman away;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
send her away. Let her get the fire at her own house.
What does she want with ours? If we allow her to
come here, we shall suffer for it some day.&rdquo; But the
other sisters would answer, &ldquo;Be quiet, Balna; why
must you always be quarreling with this poor woman?
Let her take some fire if she likes.&rdquo; Then the Purdan&rsquo;s
widow used to go to the hearth and take a few
sticks from it; and, whilst no one was looking, she
would quickly throw some mud into the midst of the
dishes which were being prepared for the Rajah&rsquo;s
dinner.</p>

<p>Now the Rajah was very fond of his daughters.
Ever since their mother&rsquo;s death they had cooked his
dinner with their own hands, in order to avoid the
danger of his being poisoned by his enemies. So,
when he found the mud mixed up with his dinner, he
thought it must arise from their carelessness, as it appeared
improbable that any one should have put mud
there on purpose; but being very kind, he did not
like to reprove them for it, although this spoiling of
the currie was repeated many successive days.</p>

<p>At last, one day, he determined to hide and watch
his daughters cooking, and see how it all happened; so
he went into the next room, and watched them through
a hole in the wall.</p>

<p>There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing
the rice and preparing the currie, and as each dish
was completed, they put it by the fire ready to be
cooked. Next he noticed the Purdan&rsquo;s widow come
to the door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to
cook her dinner with. Balna turned to her, angrily,
and said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you keep fuel in your own
house, and not come here every day and take ours?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
Sisters, don&rsquo;t give this woman any more; let her buy
it for herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the eldest sister answered, &ldquo;Balna, let the
poor woman take the wood and the fire; she does us
no harm.&rdquo; But Balna replied, &ldquo;If you let her come
here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and
make us sorry for it, some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah then saw the Purdan&rsquo;s widow go to the
place where all his dinner was nicely prepared, and, as
she took the wood, she threw a little mud into each of
the dishes.</p>

<p>At this he was very angry, and sent to have the
woman seized and brought before him. But when the
widow came, she told him that she had played this
trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him;
and she spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well
with her cunning words, that instead of punishing her,
the Rajah married her, and made her his Ranee,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and
she and her daughter came to live in the palace.</p>

<p>The new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and
wanted to get them, if possible, out of the way, in
order that her daughter might have all their riches and
live in the palace as Princess in their place; and instead
of being grateful to them for their kindness to her,
she did all she could to make them miserable. She
gave them nothing but bread to eat, and very little of
that, and very little water to drink; so these seven poor
little Princesses, who had been accustomed to have
everything comfortable about them, and good food and
good clothes all their lives long, were very miserable
and unhappy; and they used to go out every day and
sit by their dead mother&rsquo;s tomb and cry; and used to say,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children,
how unhappy we are, and how we are starved
by our cruel step-mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day, whilst they were sobbing and crying, lo and
behold! a beautiful pomelo tree<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> grew up out of the
grave, covered with fresh ripe pomeloes, and the children
satisfied their hunger by eating some of the fruit;
and every day after this, instead of trying to eat the
nasty dinner their step-mother provided for them, they
used to go out to their mother&rsquo;s grave and eat the pomeloes
which grew there on the beautiful tree.</p>

<p>Then the Ranee said to her daughter, &ldquo;I cannot tell
how it is: every day those seven girls say they don&rsquo;t want
any dinner, and won&rsquo;t eat any; and yet they never grow
thin nor look ill; they look better than you do. I cannot
tell how it is;&rdquo; and she bade her watch the seven
Princesses and see if any one gave them anything to
eat.</p>

<p>So next day, when the Princesses went to their
mother&rsquo;s grave, and were eating the beautiful pomeloes,
the Purdan&rsquo;s daughter followed them and saw
them gathering the fruit.</p>

<p>Then Balna said to her sisters, &ldquo;Do you see that
girl watching us? Let us drive her away or hide the
pomeloes, else she will go and tell her mother all about
it, and that will be very bad for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the other sisters said, &ldquo;Oh no, do not be unkind,
Balna. The girl would never be so cruel as to tell her
mother. Let us rather invite her to come and have
some of the fruit;&rdquo; and calling her to them, they gave
her one of the pomeloes.</p>

<p>No sooner had she eaten it, however, than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
Purdan&rsquo;s daughter went home and said to her mother, &ldquo;I
do not wonder the seven Princesses will not eat the
nasty dinner you prepare for them, for by their mother&rsquo;s
grave there grows a beautiful pomelo tree, and they go
there every day and eat the pomeloes. I ate one, and
it was the nicest I have ever tasted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this,
and all next day she stayed in her room, and told the
Rajah that she had a very bad headache. The Rajah
at hearing this was deeply grieved, and said to his wife,
&ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;There is
only one thing that will make my headache well. By
your dead wife&rsquo;s tomb there grows a fine pomelo tree;
you must bring that here, and boil it, root and branch,
and put a little of the water in which it has been
boiled on my forehead, and that will cure my headache.&rdquo;
So the Rajah sent his servants, and had the
beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did
as the Ranee desired; and when some of the water
in which it had been boiled was put on her forehead,
she said her headache was gone and she felt quite
well.</p>

<p>Next day, when the seven Princesses went as usual
to the grave of their mother, the pomelo tree had disappeared.
Then they all began to cry very bitterly.</p>

<p>Now there was by the Ranee&rsquo;s tomb a small tank,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
and as they were crying they saw that the tank was
filled with a rich cream-like substance, which quickly
hardened into a thick white cake. At seeing this all
the Princesses were very glad, and they ate some of the
cake, and liked it; and next day the same thing happened,
and so it went on for many days. Every morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
the Princesses went to their mother&rsquo;s grave, and
found the little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like
cake. Then the cruel step-mother said to her
daughter: &ldquo;I cannot tell how it is: I have had the pomelo
tree which used to grow by the Ranee&rsquo;s grave
destroyed, and yet the Princesses grow no thinner nor
look more sad, though they never eat the dinner I give
them. I cannot tell how it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And her daughter said, &ldquo;I will watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next day, while the Princesses were eating the cream
cake, who should come by but their step-mother&rsquo;s
daughter? Balna saw her first, and said, &ldquo;See, sisters,
there comes that girl again. Let us sit round the
edge of the tank, and not allow her to see it; for if we
give her some of our cake, she will go and tell her
mother, and that will be very unfortunate for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily
suspicious, and instead of following her advice,
they gave the Purdan&rsquo;s daughter some of the cake, and
she went home and told her mother all about it.</p>

<p>The Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses
fared, was exceedingly angry, and sent her servants to
pull down the dead Ranee&rsquo;s tomb and fill the little
tank with the ruins. And not content with this, she
next day pretended to be very, very ill&mdash;in fact, at
the point of death; and when the Rajah was much
grieved, and asked her whether it was in his power to
procure her any remedy, she said to him: &ldquo;Only one
thing can save my life, but I know you will not do it.&rdquo;
He replied, &ldquo;Yes, whatever it is, I will do it.&rdquo; She
then said, &ldquo;To save my life, you must kill the seven
daughters of your first wife, and put some of their
blood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
and their death will be my life.&rdquo; At these words the
Rajah was very sorrowful; but because he feared to
break his word, he went out with a heavy heart to find
his daughters.</p>

<p>He found them crying by the ruins of their mother&rsquo;s
grave.</p>

<p>Then, feeling he could not kill them, the Rajah
spoke kindly to them, and told them to come out into
the jungle with him; and there he made a fire and
cooked some rice, and gave it to them. But in the
afternoon, it being very hot, the seven Princesses all
fell asleep, and when he saw they were fast asleep, the
Rajah, their father, stole away and left them (for he
feared his wife), saying to himself: &ldquo;It is better my
poor daughters should die here than be killed by their
step-mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then shot a deer, and returning home, put some
of the blood on the forehead and hands of the Ranee,
and she thought then that he had really killed the
Princesses, and said she felt quite well.</p>

<p>Meantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when
they found themselves all alone in the thick jungle they
were much frightened, and began to call out as loud
as they could, in hopes of making their father hear;
but he was by that time far away, and would not have
been able to hear them, even had their voices been as
loud as thunder.</p>

<p>It so happened that this very day the seven young
sons of a neighboring Rajah chanced to be hunting in
that same jungle, and as they were returning home
after the day&rsquo;s sport was over, the youngest Prince said
to his brothers: &ldquo;Stop, I think I hear some one crying
and calling out. Do you not hear voices? Let us go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
in the direction of the sound, and try and find out what
it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the seven Princes rode through the wood until
they came to the place where the seven Princesses sat
crying and wringing their hands. At the sight of them
the young Princes were very much astonished, and still
more so on learning their story; and they settled that
each should take one of these poor forlorn ladies home
with him and marry her.</p>

<p>So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess
home with him, and married her.</p>

<p>And the second took the second;</p>

<p>And the third took the third;</p>

<p>And the fourth took the fourth;</p>

<p>And the fifth took the fifth;</p>

<p>And the sixth took the sixth;</p>

<p>And the seventh, and handsomest of all, took the
beautiful Balna.</p>

<p>And when they got to their own land, there was
great rejoicing throughout the kingdom at the marriage
of the seven young Princes to seven such beautiful
Princesses.</p>

<p>About a year after this Balna had a little son, and
his uncles and aunts were all so fond of the boy that
it was as if he had seven fathers and seven mothers.
None of the other Princes or Princesses had any children,
so the son of the seventh Prince and Balna was
acknowledged their heir by all the rest.</p>

<p>They had thus lived very happily for some time,
when one fine day the seventh Prince (Balna&rsquo;s husband)
said he would go out hunting, and away he
went; and they waited long for him, but he never
came back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
Then his six brothers said they would go and see
what had become of him; and they went away, but
they also did not return.</p>

<p>And the seven Princesses grieved very much, for they
felt sure their kind husbands must have been killed.</p>

<p>One day, not long after this had happened, as Balna
was rocking her baby&rsquo;s cradle, and whilst her sisters
were working in the room below, there came to the
palace door a man in a long black dress, who said that
he was a Fakeer,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and came to beg. The servants
said to him, &ldquo;You cannot go into the palace&mdash;the Rajah&rsquo;s
sons have all gone away; we think they must be
dead, and their widows cannot be interrupted by your
begging.&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;I am a holy man; you must
let me in.&rdquo; Then the stupid servants let him walk
through the palace, but they did not know that this
man was no Fakeer, but a wicked Magician named
Punchkin.</p>

<p>Punchkin Fakeer wandered through the palace, and
saw many beautiful things there, till at last he reached
the room where Balna sat singing beside her little boy&rsquo;s
cradle. The Magician thought her more beautiful than
all the other beautiful things he had seen, insomuch
that he asked her to go home with him and to marry
him. But she said, &ldquo;My husband, I fear, is dead, but
my little boy is still quite young; I will stay here and
teach him to grow up a clever man, and when he is
grown up he shall go out into the world, and try and
learn tidings of his father. Heaven forbid that I should
ever leave him or marry you.&rdquo; At these words the
Magician was very angry, and turned her into a little
black dog, and led her away, saying, &ldquo;Since you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
not come with me of your own free will, I will make
you.&rdquo; So the poor Princess was dragged away, without
any power of effecting an escape, or of letting her
sisters know what had become of her. As Punchkin
passed through the palace gate the servants said to him,
&ldquo;Where did you get that pretty little dog?&rdquo; And he
answered, &ldquo;One of the Princesses gave it to me as a
present.&rdquo; At hearing which they let him go without
further questioning.</p>

<p>Soon after this the six elder Princesses heard the
little baby, their nephew, begin to cry, and when they
went up stairs they were much surprised to find him
all alone, and Balna nowhere to be seen. Then they
questioned the servants, and when they heard of the
Fakeer and the little black dog, they guessed what had
happened, and sent in every direction seeking them,
but neither the Fakeer nor the dog were to be found.
What could six poor women do? They had to give
up all hopes of ever seeing their kind husbands, and
their sister and her husband again, and they devoted
themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care
of their little nephew.</p>

<p>Thus time went on, till Balna&rsquo;s son was fourteen
years old. Then one day his aunts told him the history
of the family; and no sooner did he hear it than
he was seized with a great desire to go in search of his
father and mother and uncles, and bring them home
again if he could find them alive. His aunts, on learning
his determination, were much alarmed and tried to
dissuade him, saying, &ldquo;We have lost our husbands,
and our sister and her husband, and you are now our
sole hope; if you go away, what shall we do?&rdquo; But
he replied, &ldquo;I pray you not to be discouraged; I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
return soon, and, if it is possible, bring my father and
mother and uncles with me.&rdquo; So he sat out on his
travels, but for some months he could learn nothing to
help him in his search.</p>

<p>At last, after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary
miles, and become almost hopeless of ever being able
to hear anything further of his parents, he one day came
to a country which seemed full of stones and rocks and
trees, and there he saw a large palace with a high
tower; hard by which was a Malee&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> little house.</p>

<p>As he was looking about, the Malee&rsquo;s wife saw him,
and ran out of the house and said, &ldquo;My dear boy, who
are you that dare venture to this dangerous place?&rdquo;
And he answered, &ldquo;I am a Rajah&rsquo;s son, and I come in
search of my father and my uncles, and my mother
whom a wicked enchanter bewitched.&rdquo; Then the Malee&rsquo;s
wife said, &ldquo;This country and this palace belong to
a great Enchanter; he is all-powerful, and if any one
displeases him, he can turn them into stones and trees.
All the rocks and trees you see here were living people
once, and the Magician turned them to what they now
are. Some time ago a Rajah&rsquo;s son came here, and
shortly afterward came his six brothers, and they were
all turned into stones and trees; and these are not the
only unfortunate ones, for up in that tower lives a beautiful
Princess, whom the Magician has kept prisoner
there for twelve years, because she hates him and will
not marry him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the little Prince thought, &ldquo;These must be my
parents and my uncles. I have found what I seek at
last.&rdquo; So he told his story to the Malee&rsquo;s wife, and
begged her to help him to remain in that place a while,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
and inquire further concerning the unhappy people she
mentioned; and she promised to befriend him, and advised
his disguising himself, lest the Magician should
see him, and turn him likewise into stone. To this the
Prince agreed. So the Malee&rsquo;s wife dressed him up in
a saree,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and pretended that he was her daughter.</p>

<p>One day, not long after this, as the Magician was
walking in his garden, he saw the little girl (as he
thought) playing about, and asked her who she was.
She told him she was the Malee&rsquo;s daughter, and the
Magician said, &ldquo;You are a pretty little girl, and to-morrow
you shall take a present of flowers from me to
the beautiful lady who lives in the tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young Prince was much delighted at hearing
this, and after some consultation with the Malee&rsquo;s wife,
he settled that it would be more safe for him to retain
his disguise, and trust to the chance of a favorable opportunity
for establishing some communication with his
mother, if it were indeed she.</p>

<p>Now it happened that at Balna&rsquo;s marriage her husband
had given her a small gold ring, on which her name
was engraved, and she put it on her little son&rsquo;s finger
when he was a baby, and afterward, when he was older,
his aunts had had it enlarged for him, so that he was
still able to wear it. The Malee&rsquo;s wife advised him to
fasten the well-known treasure to one of the bouquets
he presented to his mother, and trust to her recognizing
it. This was not to be done without difficulty, as such
a strict watch was kept over the poor Princess (for fear
of her ever establishing communication with her friends)
that though the supposed Malee&rsquo;s daughter was permitted
to take her flowers every day, the Magician or one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
of his slaves was always in the room at the time. At
last one day, however, opportunity favored him, and
when no one was looking the boy tied the ring to a
nosegay and threw it at Balna&rsquo;s feet. The ring fell
with a clang on the floor, and Balna, looking to see what
made the strange sound, found the little ring tied to the
flowers. On recognizing it, she at once believed the
story her son told her of his long search, and begged
him to advise her as to what she had better do; at the
same time entreating him on no account to endanger
his life by trying to rescue her. She told him that for
twelve long years the Magician had kept her shut up in
the tower because she refused to marry him, and she
was so closely guarded that she saw no hope of release.</p>

<p>Now Balna&rsquo;s son was a bright, clever boy; so he
said, &ldquo;Do not fear, dear mother; the first thing to do is
to discover how far the Magician&rsquo;s power extends, in
order that we may be able to liberate my father and
uncles, whom he has imprisoned in the form of rocks
and trees. You have spoken to him angrily for twelve
long years; do you now rather speak kindly. Tell him
you have given up all hopes of again seeing the husband
you have so long mourned, and say you are willing
to marry him. Then endeavor to find out what his
power consists in, and whether he is immortal or can
be put to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Balna determined to take her son&rsquo;s advice; and the
next day sent for Punchkin and spoke to him as had
been suggested.</p>

<p>The Magician, greatly delighted, begged her to allow
the wedding to take place as soon as possible.</p>

<p>But she told him that before she married him he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
must allow her a little more time, in which she might
make his acquaintance, and, that, after being enemies
so long, their friendship could but strengthen by degrees.
&ldquo;And do tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are you quite immortal?
Can death never touch you? And are you
too great an enchanter ever to feel human suffering?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;if I am to be your wife, I
would fain know all about you, in order, if any calamity
threatens you, to overcome, or, if possible, to avert
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I am not as others. Far,
far away, hundreds of thousands of miles from this,
there lies a desolate country covered with thick jungle.
In the midst of the jungle grows a circle of palm trees,
and in the centre of the circle stand six chattees full of
water, piled one above another; below the sixth chattee
is a small cage which contains a little green parrot: on
the life of the parrot depends my life, and if the parrot
is killed I must die. It is, however,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;impossible
that the parrot should sustain any injury, both
on account of the inaccessibility of the country, and because,
by my appointment, many thousand evil genii
surround the palm trees, and kill all who approach the
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Balna told her son what Punchkin had said, but, at
the same time, implored him to give up all idea of getting
the parrot.</p>

<p>The prince, however, replied, &ldquo;Mother, unless I can
get hold of that parrot, you and my father and uncles
cannot be liberated: be not afraid, I will shortly return.
Do you, meantime, keep the Magician in good humor&mdash;still
putting off your marriage with him on various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
pretexts; and before he finds out the cause of delay I will
return.&rdquo; So saying, he went away.</p>

<p>Many, many weary miles did he travel, till at last he
came to a thick jungle, and being very tired, sat down
under a tree and fell asleep. He was awakened by a
soft rustling sound, and looking about him, saw a large
serpent which was making its way to an eagle&rsquo;s nest
built in the tree under which he lay, and in the nest
were two young eagles. The Prince, seeing the danger
of the young birds, drew his sword and killed the
serpent; at the same moment a rushing sound was
heard in the air, and the two old eagles, who had been
out hunting for food for their young ones, returned.
They quickly saw the dead serpent and the young
Prince standing over it; and the old mother eagle said
to him, &ldquo;Dear boy, for many years all our young have
been devoured by that cruel serpent: you have now
saved the lives of our children; whenever you are in
need, therefore, send to us and we will help you; and
as for these little eagles, take them, and let them be
your servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the Prince was very glad, and the two eaglets
crossed their wings, on which he mounted; and they
carried him far, far away over the thick jungles, until
he came to the place where grew the circle of palm
trees, in the midst of which stood the six chattees full
of water. It was the middle of the day. All round
the trees were the genii fast asleep: nevertheless, there
were such countless thousands of them that it would
have been quite impossible for any one to walk through
their ranks to the place. Down swooped the strong-winged
eaglets&mdash;down jumped the prince: in an instant
he had overthrown the six chattees full of water, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
seized the little green parrot, which he rolled up in his
cloak; while, as he mounted again into the air, all the
genii below awoke, and, finding their treasure gone,
set up a wild and melancholy howl.</p>

<p>Away, away flew the little eagles till they came to
their home in the great tree; then the Prince said to
the old eagles, &ldquo;Take back your little ones; they have
done me good service; if ever again I stand in need
of help, I will not fail to come to you.&rdquo; He then continued
his journey on foot till he arrived once more at
the Magician&rsquo;s palace, where he sat down at the door
and began playing with the parrot. The Magician
saw him, and came to him quickly, and said, &ldquo;My boy,
where did you get that parrot? Give it to me, I pray
you.&rdquo; But the Prince answered, &ldquo;Oh no, I cannot
give away my parrot; it is a great pet of mine; I have
had it many years.&rdquo; Then the Magician said, &ldquo;If it is
an old favorite, I can understand your not caring to
give it away; but come, what will you sell it for?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the Prince, &ldquo;I will not sell my parrot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Magician got frightened, and said, &ldquo;Anything,
anything; name what price you will, and it
shall be yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; the Prince answered, &ldquo;I
will that you liberate the Rajah&rsquo;s seven sons who you
turned into rocks and trees.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is done as you desire,&rdquo;
said the Magician, &ldquo;only give me my parrot.&rdquo;
(And with that, by a stroke of his wand, Balna&rsquo;s husband
and his brothers resumed their natural shapes.)
&ldquo;Now give me my parrot,&rdquo; repeated Punchkin. &ldquo;Not
so fast, my master,&rdquo; rejoined the Prince; &ldquo;I must first
beg that you will restore to life all whom you have
thus imprisoned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Magician immediately waved his wand again;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
and whilst he cried in an imploring voice, &ldquo;Give me
my parrot!&rdquo; the whole garden became suddenly alive:
where rock and stones and trees had been before, stood
Rajahs and Punts<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and Sirdars,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and mighty men on
prancing horses, and jeweled pages and troops of
armed attendants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me my parrot!&rdquo; cried Punchkin. Then the
boy took hold of the parrot, and tore off one of his
wings; and as he did so the Magician&rsquo;s right arm fell
off.</p>

<p>Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying,
&ldquo;Give me my parrot!&rdquo; The Prince pulled off the
parrot&rsquo;s second wing, and the Magician&rsquo;s left arm tumbled
off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me my parrot!&rdquo; cried he, and fell on his
knees. The Prince pulled off the parrot&rsquo;s right leg&mdash;the
Magician&rsquo;s right leg fell off: the Prince pulled off
the parrot&rsquo;s left leg&mdash;down fell the Magician&rsquo;s left.</p>

<p>Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and
the head; but still he rolled his eyes, and cried, &ldquo;Give
me my parrot!&rdquo; &ldquo;Take your parrot, then,&rdquo; cried the
boy, and with that he wrung the bird&rsquo;s neck and threw
it at the Magician; and as he did so, Punchkin&rsquo;s head
twisted round, and with a fearful groan he died!</p>

<p>Then they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her
son and the seven Princes went to their own country,
and lived very happily ever afterward. And as to
the rest of the world, every one went to his own house.</p>

<br />
<i>A FUNNY STORY.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there were a Rajah and Ranee
who were much grieved because they had no
children, and the little dog in the palace had also no
little puppies. At last the Rajah and Ranee had some
children, and it also happened that the pet dog in the
palace had some little puppies; but, unfortunately, the
Ranee&rsquo;s two children were two little puppies! and the
dog&rsquo;s two little puppies were two pretty little girls!
This vexed her majesty very much; and sometimes
when the dog had gone away to its dinner, the Ranee
used to put the two little puppies (her children) into
the kennel, and carry away the dog&rsquo;s two little girls to
the palace. Then the poor dog grew very unhappy, and
said, &ldquo;They never will leave my two little children
alone. I must take them away into the jungle, or
their lives will be worried out.&rdquo; So one night she took
the little girls in her mouth and ran with them to the
jungle, and there made them a home in a pretty cave
in the rock, beside a clear stream; and every day she
would go into the towns and carry away some nice
currie and rice to give her little daughters; and if she
found any pretty clothes or jewels that she could bring
away in her mouth, she used to take them also for the
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
Now it happened some time after this, one day, when
the dog had gone to fetch her daughters&rsquo; dinner, two
young Princes (a Rajah and his brother) came to hunt
in the jungle, and they hunted all day and found nothing.
It had been very hot, and they were thirsty; so
they went to a tree which grew on a little piece of high
ground, and sent their attendants to search all round
for water; but no one could find any. At last one of
the hunting dogs came to the foot of the tree quite
muddy, and the Rajah said, &ldquo;Look, the dog is muddy:
he must have found water: follow him, and see where
he goes.&rdquo; The attendants followed the dog, and saw
him go to the stream at the mouth of the cave where
the two children were; and the two children also saw
them, and were very much frightened and ran inside
the cave. Then the attendants returned to the two
Princes, and said, &ldquo;We have found clear, sparkling
water flowing past a cave, and, what is more, within
the cave are two of the most lovely young ladies that
eye ever beheld, clothed in fine dresses and covered
with jewels; but when they saw us they were frightened
and ran away.&rdquo; On hearing this the Princes
bade their servants lead them to the place; and when
they saw the two young girls, they were quite charmed
with them, and asked them to go to their kingdom and
become their wives. The maidens were frightened;
but at last the Rajah and his brother persuaded them,
and they went, and the Rajah married the eldest sister,
and his brother married the youngest.</p>

<p>When the dog returned, she was grieved to find her
children gone, and for twelve long years the poor thing
ran many, many miles to find them, but in vain. At
last one day she came to the place where the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
Princesses lived. Now it chanced that the eldest, the wife
of the Rajah, was looking out of the window, and seeing
the dog run down the street, she said, &ldquo;That
must be my dear long-lost mother.&rdquo; So she ran into
the street as fast as possible, and took the tired dog in
her arms, and brought her into her own room, and
made her a nice comfortable bed on the floor, and
bathed her feet, and was very kind to her. Then the
dog said to her, &ldquo;My daughter, you are good and
kind, and it is a great joy to me to see you again; but
I must not stay; I will first go and see your younger
sister, and then return.&rdquo; The Ranee answered, &ldquo;Do
not do so, dear mother; rest here to-day; to-morrow I
will send and let my sister know, and she, too, will
come and see you.&rdquo; But the poor, silly dog would
not stay, but ran to the house of her second daughter.
Now the second daughter was looking out of the window
when the unfortunate creature came to the door,
and seeing the dog she said to herself, &ldquo;That must
be my mother. What will my husband think if he
learns that this wretched, ugly, miserable-looking dog
is my mother?&rdquo; So she ordered her servants to go and
throw stones at it, and drive it away, and they did so;
and one large stone hit the dog&rsquo;s head, and she ran
back, very much hurt, to her eldest daughter&rsquo;s house.
The Ranee saw her coming, and ran out into the street
and brought her in in her arms, and did all she could
to make her well, saying, &ldquo;Ah, mother, mother! why
did you ever leave my house?&rdquo; But all her care was
in vain: the poor dog died. Then the Ranee thought
her husband might be vexed if he found a dead dog
(an unclean animal) in the palace; so she put the body
in a small room into which the Rajah hardly ever went,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
intending to have it reverently buried; and over it she
placed a basket turned topsy-turvy.</p>

<p>It so happened, however, that when the Rajah came
to visit his wife, as chance would have it, he went
through this very room: and tripping over the upturned
basket, called for a light to see what it was.
Then, lo and behold! there lay the statue of a dog, life
size, composed entirely of diamonds, emeralds, and
other precious stones, set in gold! So he called out to
his wife, and said, &ldquo;Where did you get this beautiful
dog?&rdquo; And when the Ranee saw the golden dog, she
was very much frightened, and, I&rsquo;m sorry to say, instead
of telling her husband the truth, she told a story,
and said, &ldquo;Oh, it is only a present my parents sent
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now see what trouble she got into for not telling the
truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Only!</em>&rdquo; said the Rajah; &ldquo;why this is valuable
enough to buy the whole of my kingdom. Your parents
must be very rich people to be able to send you
such presents as this. How is it you never told me of
them? Where do they live?&rdquo; (Now she had to tell
another story to cover the first.) She said, &ldquo;In the
jungle.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;I will go and see them; you
must take me and show where they live.&rdquo; Then the
Ranee thought, &ldquo;What will the Rajah say when he
finds I have been telling him such stories? He will
order my head to be cut off.&rdquo; So she said, &ldquo;You
must first give me a palanquin, and I will go into the
jungle and tell them you are coming;&rdquo; but really she
determined to kill herself, and so get out of her difficulties.
Away she went; and when she had gone some
distance in her palanquin, she saw a large white ants&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
nest, over which hung a cobra, with its mouth wide
open; then the Ranee thought, &ldquo;I will go to that
cobra and put my finger in his mouth, that he may bite
me, and so I shall die.&rdquo; So she ordered the palkee-bearers
to wait, and said she would be back in a while,
and got out, and ran to the ants&rsquo; nest, and put her
finger in the cobra&rsquo;s mouth. Now a large thorn had
run, a short time before, into the cobra&rsquo;s throat, and
hurt him very much; and the Ranee, by putting her
finger into his mouth, pushed out this thorn; then the
cobra, feeling much better, turned to her, and said,
&ldquo;My dear daughter, you have done me a great kindness;
what return can I make you?&rdquo; The Ranee told
him all her story, and begged him to bite her, that she
might die. But the cobra said, &ldquo;You did certainly
very wrong to tell the Rajah that story; nevertheless,
you have been very kind to me. I will help you in
your difficulty. Send your husband here. I will provide
you with a father and mother of whom you need
not be ashamed.&rdquo; So the Ranee returned joyfully to
the palace, and invited her husband to come and see
her parents.</p>

<p>When they reached the spot near where the cobra
was, what a wonderful sight awaited them! There, in
the place which had before been thick jungle, stood a
splendid palace, twenty-four miles long and twenty-four
miles broad, with gardens and trees and fountains
all round; and the light shining from it was to be seen
a hundred miles off. The walls were made of gold and
precious stones, and the carpets cloth of gold. Hundreds
of servants, in rich dresses, stood waiting in the
long, lofty rooms; and in the last room of all, upon
golden thrones, sat a magnificent old Rajah and Ranee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
who introduced themselves to the young Rajah as his
papa and mamma-in-law. The Rajah and Ranee
stayed at the palace six months, and were entertained
the whole of that time with feasting and music; and
they left for their own home loaded with presents. Before
they started, however, the Ranee went to her friend,
the cobra, and said, &ldquo;You have conjured up all these
beautiful things to get me out of my difficulties, but my
husband, the Rajah, has enjoyed his visit so much that
he will certainly want to come here again. Then, if he
returns and finds nothing at all, he will be very angry
with me.&rdquo; The friendly cobra answered, &ldquo;Do not
fear. When you have gone twenty-four miles on your
journey, look back, and see what you will see.&rdquo; So
they started; and on looking back at the end of twenty-four
miles, saw the whole of the splendid palace in
flames, the fire reaching up to heaven. The Rajah returned
to see if he could help anybody to escape, or
invite them in their distress to his court; but he found
that all was burnt down&mdash;not a stone nor a living creature
remained!</p>

<p>Then he grieved much over the sad fate of his parents-in-law.</p>

<p>When the party returned home, the Rajah&rsquo;s brother
said to him, &ldquo;Where did you get these magnificent
presents?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;They are gifts from my
father and mother-in-law.&rdquo; At this news the Rajah&rsquo;s
brother went home to his wife very discontented, and
asked her why she had never told him of her parents,
and taken him to see them, whereby he might have received
rich gifts as well as his brother. His wife then
went to her sister, and asked how she had managed to
get all the things. But the Ranee said, &ldquo;Go away,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
you wicked woman. I will not speak to you. You
killed the poor dog, our mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But afterward she told her all about it.</p>

<p>The sister then said, &ldquo;I shall go and see the cobra,
and get presents too.&rdquo; The Ranee then answered,&mdash;&ldquo;You
can go if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the sister ordered her palanquin, and told her husband
she was going to see her parents, and prepare them
for a visit from him. When she reached the ants&rsquo; nest,
she saw the cobra there, and she went and put her finger
in his mouth, and the cobra bit her, and she died.</p>

<h2>III.<br />
<br />
<i>BRAVE SEVENTEE BAI.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>IU RAJAH,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> who reigned long years ago in the
country of Agrabrum, had an only son, to whom
he was passionately attached. The Prince, whose
name was Logedas, was young and handsome, and had
married the beautiful Princess, Parbuttee Bai.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that Siu Rajah&rsquo;s Wuzeer<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> had
a daughter called Seventee Bai (the Daisy Lady), who
was as fair as the morning, and beloved by all for her
gentleness and goodness; and when Logedas Rajah
saw her, he fell in love with her, and determined to
marry her. But when Siu Rajah heard of this he was
very angry, and sent for his son, and said: &ldquo;Of all
that is rich and costly in my kingdom I have withheld
nothing from you, and in Parbuttee Bai you have a wife
as fair as heart could wish; nevertheless, if you are
desirous of having a second wife, I freely give you
leave to do so; there are daughters of many neighboring
kings who would be proud to become your Queen,
but it is beneath your dignity to marry a Wuzeer&rsquo;s
daughter; and, if you do, my love for you shall not
prevent my expelling you from the kingdom.&rdquo; Logedas
did not heed his father&rsquo;s threat, and he married
Seventee Bai; which the Rajah learning, ordered him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
immediately to quit the country; but yet, because he
loved him much, he gave Logedas many elephants,
camels, horses, palanquins and attendants, that he
might not need help on the journey, and that his rank
might be apparent to all.</p>

<p>So Logedas Rajah and his two young wives set forth
on their travels. Before, however, they had gone very
far, the Prince dismissed the whole of his retinue, except
the elephant on which he himself rode, and the
palanquin, carried by two men, in which his wives
traveled. Thus, almost alone, he started through the
jungle in search of a new home; but, being wholly ignorant
of that part of the country, before they had gone
very far they lost their way. The poor Princesses
were reduced to a state of great misery; day after day
they wandered on, living on roots or wild berries and
the leaves of trees pounded down; and by night they
were terrified by the cries of wild beasts in search of
prey. Logedas Rajah became more melancholy and
desponding every day; until, one night, maddened by
the thought of his wives&rsquo; sad condition, and unable
longer to bear the sight of their distress, he got up,
and casting aside his royal robes, twisted a coarse handkerchief
about his head, after the manner of a fakeer&rsquo;s
(holy beggar&rsquo;s) turban, and throwing a woolen cloak
around him, ran away in disguise into the jungle.</p>

<p>A little while after he had gone, the Wuzeer&rsquo;s
daughter awoke and found Parbuttee Bai crying bitterly.
&ldquo;Sister dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what is the matter?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah,
sister,&rdquo; answered Parbuttee Bai, &ldquo;I am crying because
in my dreams I thought our husband had dressed himself
like a fakeer and run away into the jungle; and I
awoke, and found it was all true: he has gone, and left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
us here alone. It would have been better we had died
than that such a misfortune should have befallen us.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do not cry,&rdquo; said Seventee Bai: &ldquo;if we cry we are
lost, for the palkee-bearers<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> will think we are only two
weak women, and will run away, and leave us in the
jungle, out of which we can never get by ourselves.
Keep a cheerful mind, and all will be well; who
knows but we may yet find our husband? Meanwhile,
I will dress myself in his clothes, and take the name of
Seventee Rajah, and you shall be my wife; and the
palkee-bearers will think it is only I that have been
lost; and it will not seem very wonderful to them that in
such a place as this a wild beast should have devoured
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Parbuttee Bai smiled and said, &ldquo;Sister, you
speak well; you have a brave heart. I will be your little
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Seventee Bai dressed herself in her husband&rsquo;s
clothes, and next day she mounted the elephant as he
had done, and ordered the bearers to take up the palkee
in which Parbuttee Bai was, and again attempt to find
their way out of the jungle. The palkee-bearers wondered
much to themselves what had become of Seventee
Bai, and they said to one another, &ldquo;How selfish
and how fickle are the rich! See now our young
Rajah, who married the Wuzeer&rsquo;s daughter and brought
all this trouble on himself thereby (and in truth &rsquo;tis said
she was a beautiful lady), he seemed to love her as his
own soul; but now that she has been devoured by some
cruel animal in this wild jungle, he appears scarcely to
mourn her death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After journeying for some days under the wise direction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
of the Wuzeer&rsquo;s daughter, the party found themselves
getting out of the jungle, and at last they came
to an open plain, in the middle of which was a large
city. When the citizens saw the elephant coming they
ran out to see who was on it, and returning, told their
Rajah that a very handsome Rajah, richly dressed, was
riding toward the city, and that he brought with him
his wife&mdash;a most lovely Princess. Whereupon the
Rajah of that country sent to Seventee Bai, and asked
her who she was, and why she had come? Seventee
Bai replied, &ldquo;My name is Seventee Rajah. My father
was angry with me, and drove me from his kingdom;
and I and my wife have been wandering for many days
in the jungle, where we lost our way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah and all his court thought they had never
seen so brave and royal-looking a Prince; and the Rajah
said that if Seventee Rajah would take service
under him, he would give him as much money as he
liked. To whom the Wuzeer&rsquo;s daughter replied: &ldquo;I
am not accustomed to take service under anybody; but
you are good to us in receiving us courteously and offering
us your protection; therefore, give me whatever
post you please, and I will be your faithful servant.&rdquo;
So the Rajah gave Seventee Bai a salary of &pound;24,000 a-year
and a beautiful house, and treated her with the
greatest confidence, consulting her in all matters of importance,
and entrusting her with many state affairs;
and from her gentleness and kindness, none felt envious
at her good fortune, but she was beloved and honored
by all; and thus these two Princesses lived for twelve
years in that city. No one suspected that Seventee
Bai was not the Rajah she pretended to be, and she
most strictly forbade Parbuttee Bai&rsquo;s making a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
friend of anybody, or admitting any one to her confidence;
for, she said, &ldquo;Who knows, then, but some
day you may, unawares, reveal that I am only Seventee
Bai; and, though I love you as my very sister, if
that were told by you, I would kill you with my own
hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the King&rsquo;s palace was on the side of the city
nearest to the jungle, and one night the Ranee was
awakened by loud and piercing shrieks coming from
that direction; so she woke her husband, and said, &ldquo;I
am so frightened by that terrible noise that I cannot
sleep. Send some one to see what is the matter.&rdquo; And
the Rajah called all his attendants, and said, &ldquo;Go down
toward the jungle and see what that noise is about.&rdquo;
But they were all afraid, for the night was very dark,
and the noise very dreadful, and they said to him:
&ldquo;We are afraid to go. We dare not do so by ourselves.
Send for this young Rajah who is such a favorite of
yours, and tell him to go. He is brave. You pay him
more than you do us all. What is the good of your
paying him so much, unless he can be of use when he
is wanted?&rdquo; So they all went to Seventee Bai&rsquo;s house,
and when she heard what was the matter, she jumped
up, and said she would go down to the jungle and see
what the noise was.</p>

<p>This noise had been made by a Rakshas,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> who was
standing under a gallows on which a thief had been
hanged the day before. He had been trying to reach
the corpse with his cruel claws; but it was just too high
for him, and he was howling with rage and disappointment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
When, however, the Wuzeer&rsquo;s daughter reached
the place, no Rakshas was to be seen; but in his stead
a very old woman, in a wonderful glittering saree, sitting
wringing her withered hands under the gallows
tree, and above, the corpse, swaying about in the night
wind. &ldquo;Old woman,&rdquo; said Seventee Bai, &ldquo;what is
the matter?&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Rakshas (for it was
he), &ldquo;my son hangs above on that gallows. He is
dead, he is dead! and I am too bent with age to be able
to reach the rope and cut his body down.&rdquo; &ldquo;Poor old
woman!&rdquo; said Seventee Bai; &ldquo;get upon my shoulders,
and you will then be tall enough to reach your son.&rdquo;
So the Rakshas mounted on Seventee Bai&rsquo;s shoulders,
who held him steady by his glittering saree. Now, as
she stood there, Seventee Bai began to think the old
woman was a very long time cutting the rope round the
dead man&rsquo;s neck; and just at that moment the moon
shone out from behind a cloud, and Seventee Bai, looking
up, saw that instead of a feeble old woman, she was
supporting on her shoulders a Rakshas, who was tearing
down portions of the flesh and devouring it. Horror-stricken,
she sprang back, and with a shrill scream
the Rakshas fled away, leaving in her hands the shining
saree.</p>

<p>Seventee Bai did not choose to say anything about
this adventure to the Ranee, not wishing to alarm her;
so she merely returned to the palace, and said that the
noise was made by an old woman whom she had found
crying under the gallows. She then returned home,
and gave the bright saree to Parbuttee Bai.</p>

<p>One fine day, some time after this, two of the
Rajah&rsquo;s little daughters thought they would go and see
Parbuttee Bai; and as it happened, Parbuttee Bai had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
on the Rakshas&rsquo; saree, and was standing by the half-closed
window shutters looking out, when the Princesses
arrived at her house. The little Princesses were
quite dazzled by the golden saree, and running home
said to their mother, &ldquo;That young Rajah&rsquo;s wife has the
most beautiful saree we ever saw. It shines like the
sun, and dazzles one&rsquo;s eyes. We have no sarees half
so beautiful, and although you are Ranee, you have
none so rich as that. Why do you not get one too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the Ranee heard about Parbuttee Bai&rsquo;s saree
she was very eager to have one like it; and she said to
the Rajah, &ldquo;Your servant&rsquo;s wife is dressed more richly
than your Ranee. I hear Parbuttee Bai has a saree
more costly than any of mine. Now, therefore, I beg
you to get me one like hers; for I cannot rest until I
have one equally costly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Rajah sent for Seventee Bai, and said,
&ldquo;Tell me where your wife got her beautiful golden
saree; for the Ranee desires to have one like it.&rdquo;
Seventee Bai answered, &ldquo;Noble master, that saree came
from a very far country&mdash;even the country of the Rakshas.
It is impossible to get one like it here; but if
you give me leave I will go and search for their country,
and, if I succeed in finding it, bring you home
sarees of the same kind.&rdquo; And the Rajah was very
much pleased, and ordered Seventee Bai to go. So
she returned to her house and bade good-bye to Parbuttee
Bai, and warned her to be discreet and cautious;
and then, mounting her horse, rode away in search of
the Rakshas&rsquo; country.</p>

<p>Seventee Bai traveled for many days through the
jungle, going one hundred miles every day, and staying
to rest every now and then at little villages on her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
road. At last one day, after having gone several hundred
miles, she came to a fine city situated on the banks
of a beautiful river, and on the city walls a proclamation
was painted in large letters. Seventee Bai inquired
of the people what it meant, who told her that
it was to say the Rajah&rsquo;s daughter would marry any
man who could tame a certain pony belonging to her
father, which was very vicious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has no one been able to manage it?&rdquo; asked Seventee
Bai. &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Many have tried,
but failed miserably. The pony was born on the same
day as the Princess. It is so fierce that no one can approach
it; but when the Princess heard how wild it
was, she vowed she would marry no one who could
not tame it. Every one who likes is free to try.&rdquo;
Then Seventee Bai said, &ldquo;Show me the pony to-morrow.
I think I shall be able to tame it.&rdquo; They
answered, &ldquo;You can try if you like, but it is very dangerous,
and you are but a youth.&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;God
gives his strength to the weak. I do not fear.&rdquo; So
she went to sleep, and early next morning they beat a
drum all round the town to let every one know that
another man was going to try and tame the Rajah&rsquo;s
pony, and all the people flocked out of their houses to
see the sight. The pony was in a field near the river,
and Seventee Bai ran up to it, as it came running toward
her intending to trample her to death, and seized
it firmly by the mane, so that it could neither strike her
with its fore legs nor kick her. The pony tried to
shake her off, but Seventee Bai clung firmly on, and
finally jumped on its back; and when the pony found
that it was mastered, it became quite gentle and tame.
Then Seventee Bai, to show how completely she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
conquered, put spurs to the pony to make it jump the
river, and the pony immediately sprang up in the air and
right across the river (which was a jump of three miles),
and this it did three times (for it was strong and agile,
and had never been ridden before); and when all the
people saw this they shouted for joy, and ran down to
the river bank and brought Seventee Bai, riding in triumph
on the pony, to see the Rajah. And the Rajah
said, &ldquo;Oh, best of men, and worthy of all honor, you
have won my daughter.&rdquo; So he took Seventee Bai to
the palace and paid her great honor, and gave her
jewels and rich clothes, and horses and camels innumerable.
The Princess also came to greet the winner
of her hand. Then they said, &ldquo;To-morrow shall be the
wedding day.&rdquo; But Seventee Bai replied, &ldquo;Great
Rajah and beautiful Princess, I am going on an important
errand of my own Rajah&rsquo;s; let me, I pray you,
first accomplish the duty on which I am bound, and on
my way home I will come through this city and claim
my bride.&rdquo; At this they were both pleased, and the
Rajah said, &ldquo;It is well spoken. Do not let us hinder
your keeping faith with your own Rajah. Go your
way. We shall eagerly await your return, when you
shall claim the Princess and all your possessions, and
we will have such a gay wedding as was not since the
world began.&rdquo; And they went out with her to the
borders of their land, and showed her on her way.</p>

<p>So the Wuzeer&rsquo;s daughter traveled on in search of
the Rakshas&rsquo; country, until at last one day she came in
sight of another fine large town. Here she rested in
the house for travelers for some days. Now the Rajah
of this country had a very beautiful daughter, who was
his only child, and for her he had built a splendid bath.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
It was like a little sea, and had high marble walls all
around, with a hedge of spikes at the top of the walls,
so high that at a distance it looked like a great castle.
The young Princess was very fond of it, and she vowed
she would only marry a man who could jump across
her bath on horseback. This had happened some
years before, but no one had been able to do it, which
grieved the Rajah and Ranee very much; for they
wished to see their daughter happily married. And
they said to her, &ldquo;We shall both be dead before you
get a husband. What folly is this, to expect that any
one should be able to jump over those high marble
walls, with the spikes at the top!&rdquo; The Princess only
answered, &ldquo;Then I will never marry. It matters not;
I will never have a husband who has not jumped
those walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Rajah caused it to be proclaimed throughout
the land that he would give his daughter in marriage,
and great riches, to whoever could jump, on horseback,
over the Princess&rsquo; bath.</p>

<p>All this Seventee Bai learnt as soon as she arrived
in the town, and she said, &ldquo;To-morrow I will try and
jump over the Princess&rsquo; bath.&rdquo; The country people
said to her, &ldquo;You speak foolishly: it is quite impossible.&rdquo;
She replied, &ldquo;Heaven, in which I trust, will
help me.&rdquo; So next day she rose up, and saddled her
horse, and led him in front of the palace, and there she
sprang on his back, and going at full gallop, leapt over
the marble walls, over the spikes high up in the air,
and down on to the ground on the other side of the
bath; and this she did three times, which, when the
the Rajah saw, he was filled with joy, and sent for
Seventee Bai, and said, &ldquo;Tell me your name, brave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
Prince; for you are the only man in the world&mdash;you
have won my daughter.&rdquo; Then the Wuzeer&rsquo;s daughter
replied, &ldquo;My name is Seventee Rajah. I come from
a far country on a mission from my Rajah to the country
of the Rakshas; let me therefore, I pray you, first
do my appointed work, and if I live to return, I will
come through this country and claim my bride.&rdquo; To
which the Rajah consented, for he did not wish the
Princess, his daughter, to undertake so long and tiresome
a journey. It was therefore agreed that the
Princess should await Seventee Bai&rsquo;s return at her
father&rsquo;s court, and that Seventee Bai herself should
immediately proceed on her journey.</p>

<p>From this place she went on for many, many days
without adventure, and traversed a dense jungle, for
her brave heart carried her through all difficulties. At
last she arrived at another large city, beautifully situated
by a lake, with blue hills rising behind it, and
sheltering it from the cutting winds; little gardens
filled with pomegranates, jasmine and other fragrant
and lovely flowers reached down from the city to the
water&rsquo;s edge.</p>

<p>Seventee Bai, tired with her long journey, rode up
to one of the Malees&rsquo; houses, where the hospitable
inmates, seeing she was a stranger and weary, offered
her food and shelter for the night, which she thankfully
accepted.</p>

<p>As they all sat round the fire cooking their evening
meal, Seventee Bai asked the Malee&rsquo;s wife about the
place and the people, and what was going on in the
town. &ldquo;Much excitement,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;has of late
been caused by our Rajah&rsquo;s dream, which no one can
interpret.&rdquo; &ldquo;What did he dream?&rdquo; asked Seventee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
Bai. &ldquo;Ever since he was ten years old,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;he has dreamed of a fair tree growing in a large garden.
The stem of the tree is made of silver, the leaves
are pure gold, and the fruit is bunches of pearls. The
Rajah has inquired of all his wise men and seers where
such a tree is to be found; but they all replied, &lsquo;There
is no such tree in the world;&rsquo; wherefore he is dissatisfied
and melancholy. Moreover, the Princess, his
daughter, hearing of her father&rsquo;s dream, has determined
to marry no man save the finder of this marvelous
tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is very odd,&rdquo; said Seventee Bai; and, their
supper being over, she dragged her mattress outside
the little house (as a man would have done), and,
placing it in a sheltered nook near the lake, knelt down,
as her custom was, to say her prayers before going to
sleep.</p>

<p>As she knelt there, with her eyes fixed on the dark
water, she saw, on a sudden, a glorious shining light
coming slowly toward her, and discovered, in a minute
or two more, that a very large cobra was crawling up
the steps from the water&rsquo;s edge, having in his mouth
an enormous diamond, the size and shape of an egg,
that sparkled and shone like a little sun, or as if one
of the stars had suddenly dropped out of heaven. The
cobra laid the diamond down at the top of the steps,
and crawled away in search of food. Presently returning
when the night was far spent, he picked up the
diamond again, and slid down the steps with it into
the lake. Seventee Bai knew not what to make of
this, but she resolved to return to the same place next
night and watch for the cobra.</p>

<p>Again she saw him bring the diamond in his mouth,
and take it away with him after his evening meal; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
again, a third night, the same thing. Then Seventee
Bai determined to kill the cobra, and if possible secure
the diamond. So early next morning she went into
the bazaar, and ordered a blacksmith to make her a
very strong iron trap, which should catch hold of anything
it was let down upon so firmly as to require the
strength of twelve men to get out of it. The blacksmith
did as he was ordered, and made a very strong
trap; the lower part of it was like knives, and when it
caught hold of anything it required the strength of
twelve men to break through it and escape.</p>

<p>Seventee Bai had this trap hung up by a rope to a
tree close to the lake, and all around she scattered
flowers and sweet scents, such as cobras love; and at
nightfall she herself got into the tree just above the
trap, and waited for the cobra to come as he was
wont.</p>

<p>About twelve o&rsquo;clock the cobra came up the steps
from the lake in search of food. He had the diamond
in his mouth, and, attracted by the sweet scents and
flowers, instead of going into the jungle, he proceeded
toward the tree in which Seventee Bai was.</p>

<p>When Seventee Bai saw him, she untied the rope
and let down the trap upon him; but for fear he might
not be quite dead, she waited till morning before going
to get the diamond.</p>

<p>As soon as the sun was up, she went to look at her
prey. There he lay cold and dead, with the diamond,
which shone like a mountain of light, in his mouth.
Seventee Bai took it, and, tired by her night of watching,
thought she would bathe in the lake before returning
to the Malee&rsquo;s cottage. So she ran and knelt down
by the brink, to dip her hands and face in the cool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
water; but no sooner did she touch its surface with the
diamond, than it rolled back in a wall on either hand,
and she saw a pathway leading down below the lake,
on each side of which were beautiful houses and gardens
full of flowers, red, and white, and blue. Seventee
Bai resolved to see whither this might lead, so she
walked down the path until she came opposite a large
door. She opened it, and found herself in a more
lovely garden than she had ever seen on earth; tall
trees laden with rich fruit grew in it, and on the boughs
were bright birds singing melodiously, while the ground
was covered with flowers, among which flew many
gaudy butterflies.</p>

<p>In the centre of the garden grew one tree more beautiful
than all the rest: <em>the stem was of silver, the leaves
were golden, and the fruit was clusters of pearls</em>.
Swinging amid the branches sat a young girl, more
fair than any earthly lady; she had a face like the
angels which men only see in dreams; her eyes were
like two stars, her golden hair fell in ripples to her
feet; she was singing to herself. When she saw the
stranger, she gave a little cry, and said, &ldquo;Ah, my
lord, why do you come here?&rdquo; Seventee Bai answered,
&ldquo;May I not come to see you, beautiful lady?&rdquo;
Then the lady said, &ldquo;Oh, sir, you are welcome; but
if my father sees you here, he will kill you. I am the
great Cobra&rsquo;s daughter, and he made this garden for
me to play in, and here I have played these many,
many years all alone, for he lets me see no one, not
even of our own subjects. I never saw any one before
you. Speak, beautiful Prince&mdash;tell me how you came
here, and who you are?&rdquo; Seventee Bai answered, &ldquo;I
am Seventee Rajah: have no fear&mdash;the stern Cobra is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
no more.&rdquo; Then the lady was joyful, when she heard
that the Cobra who had tyrannized over her was dead,
and she said her name was Hera Bai (the Diamond
Lady), and that she was possessor of all the treasures
under the lake; and she said to Seventee Bai, &ldquo;Stay
with me here; you shall be king of all this country,
and I will be your wife.&rdquo; &ldquo;That cannot be,&rdquo; answered
Seventee Bai, &ldquo;for I have been sent on a mission
by my Rajah, and I must continue my journey
until I have accomplished it; but if you love me as I
love you, come rather with me to my own land, and
you shall be my wife.&rdquo; Hera Bai shook her head.
&ldquo;Not so, dearest,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for if I go with you, all
the people will see how fair I am, and they will kill
you, and sell me for a slave; and so I shall bring evil
upon you, and not good. But take this flute, dear
husband (and saying this, she gave Seventee Bai a little
golden flute); whenever you wish to see me, or are in
need of my aid, go into the jungle and play upon it,
and before the sound ceases I will be there; but do not
play it in the towns, nor yet amid a crowd.&rdquo; Then
Seventee Bai put the flute in the folds of her dress, and
she bade farewell to Hera Bai and went away.</p>

<p>When she came back to the Malee&rsquo;s cottage, the Malee&rsquo;s
wife said to her, &ldquo;We became alarmed about you,
sir; for two days we have seen nothing of you; and we
thought you must have gone away. Where have you
been so long?&rdquo; Seventee Bai answered, &ldquo;I had business
of my own in the bazaar&rdquo; (for she did not choose to
tell the Malee&rsquo;s wife that she had been under the lake);
&ldquo;now go and inquire what time your Rajah&rsquo;s Wuzeer
can give a stranger audience, for I must see him before
I leave this city.&rdquo; So the Malee&rsquo;s wife went; whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
she was gone, Seventee Bai went down again to the
edge of the lake, and there reverently burnt the cobra&rsquo;s
body, both for the sake of Hera Bai, and because the
cobra is a sacred animal. Next day (the Malee&rsquo;s wife
having brought a favorable answer from the palace)
Seventee Bai went to see the Wuzeer. Now the
Wuzeer wondered much why she came to see him, and
he said, &ldquo;Who are you, and what is your errand?&rdquo;
Whereupon she answered, &ldquo;I am Seventee Rajah. I
am going a long journey on my own Rajah&rsquo;s account,
and happening to be passing through this city, I came
to pay you a friendly visit.&rdquo; Then the Wuzeer became
quite cordial, and talked with Seventee Bai about the
country and the city, and the Rajah and his wonderful
dream. And Seventee Bai said, &ldquo;What do you suppose
your Rajah would give to any one who could
show him the tree of which he has so often dreamed?&rdquo;
The Wuzeer replied, &ldquo;He would certainly give him
his daughter in marriage and the half of his kingdom.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Seventee Bai, &ldquo;tell your master that,
upon these conditions, if he likes to send for me, I will
show him the tree; he may look at it for one night, but
he cannot have it for his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wuzeer took the message to the Rajah, and
next day the Wuzeer, the Sirdars, and all the great men
of the court, went in state by the Rajah&rsquo;s order to the
Malee&rsquo;s hut, to say that he was willing to grant all
Seventee Rajah&rsquo;s demands, and would like to see the
tree that very night. Seventee Bai thereupon promised
the Wuzeer that if the Rajah would come with his
court, he should see the reality of his dream. Then
she went into the jungle and played on her little flute,
and Hera Bai immediately appeared as she had seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
her before, swinging in the silver tree; and when she
heard what Seventee Bai wanted, she bade her bring
the Rajah, who should see it without fail.</p>

<p>When the Rajah came, he and all his court were
overcome with astonishment; for there, in the midst of
the desolate jungle, was a beautiful palace; fountains
played in every court, the rooms were richly decorated
with thousands and thousands of shining jewels; a
light as clear as day filled all the place, soft music was
played around by unseen hands, sweet odors filled the
air, and in the midst of the palace garden there grew
<em>a silver tree, with golden leaves and fruit of pearls</em>.</p>

<p>The next morning all had disappeared; but the Rajah,
enchanted with what he had seen, remained true
to his promise, and agreed to give Seventee Bai the
half of his kingdom and his daughter in marriage; for,
said he to himself, &ldquo;A man who can convert the jungle
into a paradise in one night must surely be rich
enough and clever enough to be my son-in-law.&rdquo; But
Seventee Bai said, &ldquo;I am now employed on an errand
of my Rajah&rsquo;s; let me, I beg, first accomplish it, and
on my homeward journey I will remain a while in this
town, and will marry the Princess.&rdquo; So they gave him
leave to go, and the Rajah and all the great men of his
kingdom accompanied Seventee Bai to the borders of
their land. Thence the Wuzeer&rsquo;s daughter went on
journeying many days until she had left that country
far behind; but as yet she had gained no clue as to the
way to the Rakshas&rsquo; land. In this difficulty she bethought
her of Hera Bai, and played upon the little
golden flute. Hera Bai immediately appeared, saying,
&ldquo;Husband, what can I do for you?&rdquo; Seventee Bai
answered, &ldquo;Kind Hera, I have now been wandering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
in this jungle for many days, endeavoring in vain to
discover the Rakshas&rsquo; country, whither my Rajah has
ordered me to go. Can you help me to get there?&rdquo;
She answered, &ldquo;You cannot go there by yourself.
For a six months&rsquo; journey round their land there is
placed a Rakshas&rsquo; guard, and not a sparrow could find
his way into the country without their knowledge and
permission. No men are admitted there, and there are
more Rakshas employed in keeping guard than there
are trees on the face of the earth. They are invisible,
but they would see you, and instantly tear you to pieces.
Be, however, guided by me, and I will contrive a way
by which you may gain what you seek. Take this
ring (and so saying, she placed a glorious ring on Seventee
Bai&rsquo;s finger); it was given me by my dearest
friend, the Rajah of the Rakshas&rsquo; daughter, and will
render you invisible. Look at that mountain, whose
blue head you can just see against the sky; you must
climb to the top of that, for it stands on the borders of
the Rakshas&rsquo; territory. When there, turn the stone on
the ring I have given you toward the palm of your
hand, and you will instantly fall through the earth into
the space below the mountain where the Rakshas&rsquo;
Rajah holds his court, and find yourself in his
daughter&rsquo;s presence. Tell her you are my husband;
she will love and help you for my sake.&rdquo; Hera Bai so
saying disappeared, and Seventee Bai continued her
journey until she reached the mountain top, where she
turned the ring round as she had been bidden, and immediately
found herself falling through the earth, down,
down, down, deeper and deeper, until at last she arrived
in a beautiful room, richly furnished, and hung round
with cloth of gold. In every direction, as far as the eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
could reach, were thousands and thousands of Rakshas,
and in the centre of the room was a gold and ivory
throne, on which sat the most beautiful Princess that
it is possible to imagine. She was tall and of a commanding
aspect; her black hair was bound by long
strings of pearl; her dress was of fine spun gold, and
round her waist was clasped a zone of restless, throbbing,
light-giving diamonds; her neck and her arms
were covered with a profusion of costly jewels; but
brighter than all shone her bright eyes, which looked
full of gentle majesty. She could see Seventee Bai,
although her attendants could not, because of the magic
ring; and as soon as she saw her she started and cried,
&ldquo;Who are you? How came you here?&rdquo; Seventee
Bai answered, &ldquo;I am Seventee Rajah, the husband of
the Lady Hera, and I have come here by the power of
the magic ring you gave her.&rdquo; The Rakshas&rsquo; Princess
then said, &ldquo;You are welcome: but you must know that
your coming is attended with much danger; for, did
the guard placed around me by my father know of your
presence, they would instantly put you to death, and I
should be powerless to save you. Tell me why did
you come?&rdquo; Seventee Bai answered, &ldquo;I came to see
you, beautiful lady; tell me your name, and how it is
you are here all alone.&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;I am the Rakshas&rsquo;
Rajah&rsquo;s only daughter, and my name is Tara Bai
(the Star Lady), and because my father loves me very
much he has built this palace for me, and placed this
great guard of Rakshas all round for many thousand
miles, to prevent any one coming in or out without his
permission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So great is the state they keep that I seldom see
my father and mother; indeed, I have not seen them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
for several years. Nevertheless, I will go now in person
to implore their protection for you; for though I
never saw king nor prince before, I love you very
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, she arose to go to her father&rsquo;s court, bidding
Seventee Bai await her return.</p>

<p>When the Rajah and Ranee of the Rakshas heard
that their daughter was coming to see them, they were
very much surprised, and said, &ldquo;What can be the matter
with our daughter? Can she be ill? or can our
Tara Bai be unhappy in the beautiful house we have
given her?&rdquo; And they said to her, &ldquo;Daughter, why do
you come? what is the matter?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;Oh,
my father! I come to tell you I should like to be married.
Cannot you find some beautiful Prince to be my
husband?&rdquo; Then the Rajah laughed, and said, &ldquo;You
are but a child still, my daughter; nevertheless, if you
wish for a husband, certainly, if any Prince comes
here, and asks you in marriage, we will let you wed
him.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;If some brave and beautiful Prince
were to come here, and get through the great guard
you have placed around the palace, would you indeed
protect him for my sake, and not allow them to tear
him in pieces?&rdquo; The Rajah answered, &ldquo;If such a
one come, he shall be safe.&rdquo; Then Tara Bai was very
joyful, and ran and fetched Seventee Bai, and said to
her father and mother, &ldquo;See here is Seventee Rajah,
the young Prince of whom I spoke.&rdquo; And when the
Rajah and Ranee saw Seventee Bai they were greatly
astonished, and could not think how she had managed
to reach their land, and they thought she must be very
brave and wise to have done so. And because also
Seventee Bai looked a very noble Prince, they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
the more willing that she should marry Tara Bai, and
said, &ldquo;Seventee Rajah, we are willing you should be
our son-in-law, for you look good and true, and you
must be brave, to have come so long and dangerous a
journey for your wife; now, therefore, you shall be
married; the whole land is open to you, and all that we
have is yours; only take good care of our dear daughter,
and if ever she or you are unhappy, return here and
you shall find a home with us.&rdquo; So the wedding took
place amidst great rejoicings. The wedding festivities
lasted twelve days, and to it came hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of Rakshas from every country
under heaven; from the north and the south and the
east and the west, from the depths of the earth and the
uttermost parts of the sea. Troop after troop they came
flocking in, an ever-increasing crowd, from all parts of
this wide world, to be present at the marriage of their
master&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to count all the rich and
costly presents that the Rakshas&rsquo; Rajah and Ranee
gave Tara Bai. There were jewels enough to fill the
seas; diamonds and emeralds, rubies, sapphires and
pearls; gold and silver, costly hangings, carved ebony
and ivory, more than a man could count in a hundred
years; for the Rajah gave his daughter a guard of
100,000,000,000,000 Rakshas, and each Rakshas carried
a bundle of riches, and each bundle was as big as
a house! and so they took leave of the Rakshas&rsquo; Rajah
and Ranee, and left the Rakshas&rsquo; country.</p>

<p>When they got to the country of the Rajah who had
dreamed about the silver tree, with leaves of gold and
fruit of pearl (because the number of their retinue was
so great that if they had come into a country they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
would have devoured all that was in it like a swarm of
locusts), Seventee Bai and Tara Bai determined that
Tara Bai should stay with the guard of Rakshas in the
jungle, on the borders of the Rajah&rsquo;s dominions, and
that Seventee Bai should go to the city, as she had promised,
to marry the Rajah&rsquo;s daughter. And there they
stayed a week, and the Rajah&rsquo;s daughter was married
with great pomp and ceremony to Seventee Bai; and
when they left the city the Rajah gave Seventee Bai
and the bride, his daughter, horses and camels and elephants,
and rich robes and jewels innumerable; and he
and all his court accompanied them to the borders of
the land.</p>

<p>Thence they went to the country where lived the
Princess whose great marble bath Seventee Bai had
jumped over; and there Seventee Bai was married to
her, amid great rejoicings, and the wedding was one of
surpassing splendor, and the wedding festivities lasted
for three whole days.</p>

<p>And leaving that city, they traveled on until they
reached the city where Seventee Bai had tamed the
Rajah&rsquo;s wild pony, and there they spent two days in
great honor and splendor, and Seventee Bai married
that Princess also; so with her five wives&mdash;that is to
say, Hera Bai the Rajah of the Cobras&rsquo; daughter, Tara
Bai the Rajah of the Rakshas&rsquo; daughter, and the three
other Princesses&mdash;and a great tribe of attendants and
elephants and camels and horses, she returned to the
city where she had left Parbuttee Bai.</p>

<p>Now when news was brought to Seventee Bai&rsquo;s master
(the friendly Rajah), of the great cavalcade that
was approaching his city, he became very much alarmed,
taking Seventee Bai for some strange Rajah who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
had come to make war upon him. When Seventee
Bai heard how alarmed he was, she sent a messenger
to him, on a swift horse, to say, &ldquo;Be not alarmed; it is
only thy servant, Seventee Rajah, returning from the
errand on which thou didst send him.&rdquo; Then the
Rajah&rsquo;s heart was light, and he ordered a royal salute
to be fired, and went out with all his court to meet
Seventee Bai, and they all went together in a state
procession into the city. And Seventee Bai said to
the Rajah, &ldquo;You sent your servant to the Rakshas&rsquo;
country to fetch a golden saree for the Ranee. Behold,
I have done as you wish.&rdquo; And so saying, she gave to
the Rajah five Rakshas&rsquo; bundles of rich hangings and
garments covered with jewels (that is to say, five
housefuls of costly things; for each Rakshas carried as
much in the bundle on his shoulders as a house would
hold); and to the Wuzeer she gave two bundles.</p>

<p>After this, Seventee Bai discharged almost all her
immense train of attendants (for fear they should
create a famine in the land), sending them to their own
houses with many valuable presents; and she took the
three Princesses, her wives, to live with her and Parbuttee
Bai; but Hera Bai and Tara Bai, on account
of their high rank and their surpassing beauty, had a
splendid palace of their own in the jungle, of which no
one knew but Seventee Bai.</p>

<p>Now when she again saw Seventee Bai, the Rajah&rsquo;s
little daughter said to her father, &ldquo;Father, I do not
think there is such a brave and beautiful Prince in all
the world as this Seventee Rajah. I would rather have
him for my husband than any one else.&rdquo; And the
Rajah said, &ldquo;Daughter, I am very willing you should
marry him.&rdquo; So it was settled Seventee Bai should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
marry the little Princess; but she said to the Rajah,
&ldquo;I am willing to marry your daughter, but we must
have a very grand wedding; give me time, therefore,
to send into all the countries round, and invite all their
Rajahs to be present at the ceremony.&rdquo; And to this
the Rajah agreed.</p>

<p>Now, about this time, Seventee Bai one day found
Parbuttee Bai crying, and said to her, &ldquo;Little sister,
why are you unhappy?&rdquo; And Parbuttee Bai answered,
&ldquo;Oh sister, you have brought us out of all our
difficulties, and won us honor and great riches, but yet
I do not feel merry; for I cannot help thinking of our
poor husband, who is now, maybe, wandering about a
wretched beggar, and I long with my whole heart to
see him again.&rdquo; Then Seventee Bai said, &ldquo;Well,
cheer up, do not cry; mind those women do not find
out I am not Seventee Rajah. Keep a good heart, and
I will try and find your husband for you.&rdquo; So Seventee
Bai went into the jungle palace to see Hera Bai,
and said to her, &ldquo;I have a friend whom I have not
seen since he became mad twelve years ago, and ran
away into the jungle disguised as a Fakeer. I should
like very much to find out if he is still alive. How can
I learn?&rdquo; Now Hera Bai was a very wise Princess,
and she answered, &ldquo;Your best plan will be to provide
a great feast for the poor, and cause it to be proclaimed
in all lands, far and near, that you are about to give it
as a thank-offering for all the blessings God has bestowed
on you. The poor will flock from all countries
to come to it, and perhaps among the rest you may
find your friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seventee Bai did as Hera Bai had advised, causing
two long tables to be spread in the jungle, whereat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
hundreds of poor from all parts of the world were daily
entertained; and every day, for six months, Seventee
Bai and Parbuttee Bai walked down the long rows of
people, apparently to see how they were all getting on,
but in reality to look for Logedas Rajah; but they
found him not.</p>

<p>At last one day, as Seventee Bai was going her accustomed
round, she saw a wretched wild-looking man,
black as pitch, with tangled hair, a thin wrinkled face,
and in his hand a wooden bowl, such as Fakeers carry
about to collect broken meat and scraps of bread in,
and touching Parbuttee Bai, she said to her, &ldquo;See,
Parbuttee, there is your husband.&rdquo; When Parbuttee
Bai saw this pitiful sight (for it was, indeed, Logedas,
but so changed and altered that even his wives hardly
recognized him), she began to cry. Then Seventee
Bai said, &ldquo;Do not cry; go home quickly. I will take
care of him.&rdquo; And when Parbuttee Bai was gone, she
called one of the guard and said to him, &ldquo;Catch hold
of that man and put him in prison.&rdquo; Then Logedas
Rajah said, &ldquo;Why do you seize me? I have done no
harm to any one.&rdquo; But Seventee Bai ordered the
guard not to heed his remonstrances, but to take him
to prison instantly, for she did not wish the people
around to discover how interested she was in him. So
the guard took Logedas Rajah away to lock him up.
Poor Logedas Rajah said to them, &ldquo;Why has this
wicked Rajah had me taken prisoner? I have harmed
no one. I have not fought, nor robbed; but for twelve
years I have been a wretched beggar, living on the
bread of charity.&rdquo; For he did not tell them he was a
Rajah&rsquo;s son, for he knew they would only laugh at
him. They replied. &ldquo;You must not call our Rajah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
wicked; it is you that are wicked, and not he, and
doubtless he will have your head cut off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they put him in prison he begged them again
to say what was to be done to him. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;you will certainly be hanged to-morrow morning, or
perhaps, if you like it better, beheaded, in front of the
palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now as soon as Seventee Bai got home, she sent for
her head servants, and said to them, &ldquo;Go at once to
the prison, and order the guard to give you up the
Fakeer I gave into their charge, and bring him here in
a palanquin, but see that he does not escape.&rdquo; Then
Seventee Bai ordered them to lock up Logedas in a
distant part of the palace, and commanded that he
should be washed, and dressed in new clothes, and
given food, and that a barber should be sent for, to cut
his hair and trim his beard. Then Logedas said to his
keepers, &ldquo;See how good the Rajah is to me! He will
not surely hang me after this.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, never fear,&rdquo;
they answered; &ldquo;when you are dressed up and made
very smart, it will be a much finer sight to see you
hanged than before.&rdquo; Thus they tried to frighten the
poor man. After this Seventee Bai sent for all the
greatest doctors in the kingdom, and said to them, &ldquo;If
a Rajah wanders about for twelve years in the jungle,
until all trace of his princely beauty is lost, how long
will it take you to restore him to his original likeness?&rdquo;
They answered, &ldquo;With care and attention it may be
done in six months.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Seventee Bai,
&ldquo;there is a friend of mine now in my palace of whom
this is the case. Take him and treat him well, and at
the end of six months I shall expect to see him restored
to his original health and strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
So Logedas was placed under the doctors&rsquo; care; but
all this time he had no idea who Seventee Bai was, nor
why he was thus treated. Every day Seventee Bai
came to see him and talk to him. Then he said to his
keepers, &ldquo;See, good people, how kind this great Rajah
is, coming to see me every day; he can intend for me
nothing but good.&rdquo; To which they would answer,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be in a hurry; none can fathom the hearts
of kings. Most probably, for all this delay, he will in
the end have you taken and hanged.&rdquo; Thus they
amused themselves by alarming him.</p>

<p>Then, some day, when Seventee Bai had been more
than usually kind, Logedas Rajah would say again, &ldquo;I
do not fear the Rajah&rsquo;s intentions toward me. Did
you not notice how very kind he was to-day!&rdquo; And to
this his keepers would reply&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless it is amusing for him, but hardly, we
should think, for you. He will play with you probably
for some time (as a cat does with a mouse); but in
three months is the Rajah&rsquo;s birthday; most likely he is
keeping you to kill you then.&rdquo; And so the time wore
on.</p>

<p>Seventee Bai&rsquo;s birthday was fixed for the day also of
her wedding with the Rajah&rsquo;s daughter. For this great
event immense preparations were made all over the
plain outside the city walls. Tents made of cloth of
gold were pitched in a great square, twelve miles long
and twelve miles broad, for the accommodation of the
neighboring Rajahs, and in the centre was a larger
tent than all the rest, covered with jewels and shining
like a great golden temple, in which they were to assemble.</p>

<p>Then Seventee Bai said to Parbuttee Bai, &ldquo;On my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
birthday I will restore you to your husband.&rdquo; But Parbuttee
Bai was vexed and said, &ldquo;I cannot bear the
thought of him; it is such a terrible thing to think of
our once handsome husband as none other than that
miserable Fakeer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seventee Bai smiled. &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think
you will find him again altered, and for the better.
You cannot think what a change rest and care have
made in him; but he does not know who we are, and
as you value my happiness, tell no one now that I am
not the Rajah.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed I will not, dearest sister,&rdquo;
answered Parbuttee Bai. &ldquo;I should in truth be loath
to vex you, after all you have done for me; for owing
to you here have we lived happily for twelve years like
sisters, and I do not think as clever a woman as you
was ever before born in this world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among other guests invited to the wedding were Siu
Rajah and his wife, and the Wuzeer, Seventee Bai&rsquo;s
father, and her mother. Seventee Bai arranged thrones
for them all, made of gold and emeralds, and diamonds,
and rubies, and ivory. And she ordered that
in the seat of honor on her left-hand side should be
placed the Wuzeer, her father, and next to him her
mother, and next to them Siu Rajah and his wife,
and after them all the other Rajahs and Ranees, according
to their rank; and all the Rajahs and Ranees wondered
much that the place of honor should have been
given to the stranger Wuzeer. Then Seventee Bai
took her most costly Rajah dress, and ordered that Logedas
Rajah should be clothed in it, and escorted to the
tent; and she took off the man&rsquo;s clothes which she had
worn, and dressed herself in a saree. When she was
dressed in it she looked a more lovely woman than she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
had before looked a handsome man. And she went to
the tent leading Parbuttee Bai, while with her came
Hera Bai and Tara Bai of more than mortal beauty,
and the three other Princesses clothed in the most costly
robes. Then before all the Rajahs and Ranees, Seventee
Bai knelt down at Logedas Rajah&rsquo;s feet, and said to
him, &ldquo;I am your true wife. O husband, have you forgotten
her whom you left in the jungle with Parbuttee
Bai twelve years ago? See here she also is; and behold
these rich jewels, these tents of gold, these hangings
of priceless worth, these elephants, camels, horses,
attendants and all this wealth. It is all yours, as I am
yours; for I have collected all for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Logedas Rajah wept for joy, and Siu Rajah
arose and kissed Seventee Bai, and said to her, &ldquo;My
noble daughter, you have rescued my son from misery,
and done more wisely and well than woman ever did
before. May all honor and blessing attend you henceforth
and for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the assembled Rajahs and Ranees were surprised
beyond measure, saying, &ldquo;Did any one ever
hear of a woman doing so much?&rdquo; But more than any
was the good Rajah astonished, whom Seventee Bai had
served so well for twelve years, and whose daughter
she was to have married that day, when he learnt that
she was a woman! It was then agreed by all that
Logedas Rajah should on that day be newly married to
his two wives, Parbuttee Bai and Seventee Bai; and
should also marry the six other beautiful Princesses&mdash;the
Princess Hera Bai, the Princess Tara Bai, the Rajah&rsquo;s
little daughter, and the three other Princesses; and
that he should return with his father to his own kingdom.
And the weddings took place amid great splendor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
and rejoicings unheard of; and of all the fine things
that were seen and done on that day it is impossible to
tell. And afterward Logedas Rajah and his eight
wives, and his father and mother, and the Wuzeer and
his wife, and all their attendants, returned to their own
land, where they all lived very happily ever after.
And so may all who read this story live happily too.</p>

<h2>IV.<br />
<br />
<i>TRUTH&rsquo;S TRIUMPH.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>EVERAL hundred years ago there was a certain
Rajah who had twelve wives, but no children,
and though he caused many prayers to be said, and
presents made in temples far and near, never a son nor
a daughter had he. Now this Rajah had a Wuzeer
who was a very, very wise old man, and it came to
pass that one day, when he was traveling in a distant
part of his kingdom, accompanied by this Wuzeer and
the rest of his court, he came upon a large garden, in
walking round which he was particularly struck by a
little tree which grew there. It was a bringal<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> tree,
not above two feet in height. It had no leaves, but on
it grew a hundred and one bringals. The Rajah
stopped to count them, and then turning to the Wuzeer
in great astonishment, said, &ldquo;It is to me a most unaccountable
thing, that this little tree should have no
leaves, but a hundred and one bringals growing on it.
You are a wise man&mdash;can you guess what this means?&rdquo;
The Wuzeer replied, &ldquo;I can interpret this marvel to
you, but if I do, you will most likely not believe me;
promise therefore that if I tell you, you will not cause
me to be killed as having told (as you imagine) a lie.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
The Rajah promised, and the Wuzeer continued:
&ldquo;The meaning of this little bringal tree, with the hundred
and one bringals growing on it, is this. Whoever
marries the daughter of the Malee in charge of this
garden will have a hundred and one children&mdash;a hundred
sons and one daughter.&rdquo; The Rajah said,
&ldquo;Where is the maiden to be seen?&rdquo; The Wuzeer answered,
&ldquo;When a number of great people like you
and all your court come into a little village like this,
the poor people, and especially the children, are frightened
and run away and hide themselves; therefore, as
long as you stay here as Rajah you cannot hope to see
her. Your only means will be to send away your
suite, and cause it be announced that you have left the
place. Then, if you walk daily in this garden, you
may some morning meet the pretty Guzra Bai,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> of
whom I speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this advice the Rajah acted; and one day
whilst walking in the garden he saw the Malee&rsquo;s young
daughter, a girl of twelve years old, busy gathering
flowers. He went forward to accost her, but she, seeing
that he was not one of the villagers, but a stranger,
was shy, and ran home to her father&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>The Rajah followed, for he was very much struck
with her grace and beauty; in fact, he fell in love with
her as soon as he saw her, and thought he had never
seen a king&rsquo;s daughter half so charming.</p>

<p>When he got to the Malee&rsquo;s house the door was shut;
so he called out, &ldquo;Let me in, good Malee; I am the
Rajah, and I wish to marry your daughter.&rdquo; The
Malee only laughed, and answered, &ldquo;A pretty tale to
tell a simple man, indeed! You a Rajah! why the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
Rajah is miles away. You had better go home, my
good fellow, for there&rsquo;s no welcome for you here!&rdquo;
But the Rajah continued calling till the Malee opened
the door; who then was indeed surprised, seeing it was
truly no other than the Rajah, and he asked what he
could do for him.</p>

<p>The Rajah said, &ldquo;I wish to marry your beautiful
daughter, Guzra Bai.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the Malee,
&ldquo;this joke won&rsquo;t do. None of your Princes in disguise
for me. You may think you are a great Rajah and I
only a poor Malee, but I tell you that makes no difference
at all to me. Though you were king of all the
earth, I would not permit you to come here and amuse
yourself chattering to my girl, only to fill her head with
nonsense, and to break her heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In truth, good man, you do me wrong,&rdquo; answered
the Rajah, humbly: &ldquo;I mean what I say; I wish to
marry your daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not think,&rdquo; retorted the Malee, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ll make
a fool of myself because I&rsquo;m only a Malee, and believe
what you&rsquo;ve got to say, because you&rsquo;re a great Rajah.
Rajah or no Rajah is all one to me. If you mean
what you say, if you care for my daughter and wish to
be married to her, come and be married; but I&rsquo;ll have
none of your new-fangled forms and court ceremonies
hard to be understood; let the girl be married by her
father&rsquo;s hearth and under her father&rsquo;s roof, and let us
invite to the wedding our old friends and acquaintance
whom we&rsquo;ve known all our lives, and before we ever
thought of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah was not angry, but amused, and rather
pleased than otherwise at the old man&rsquo;s frankness, and
he consented to all that was desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
The village beauty, Guzra Bai, was therefore married
with as much pomp as they could muster, but in
village fashion, to the great Rajah, who took her home
with him, followed by the tears and blessings of her
parents and playmates.</p>

<p>The twelve kings&rsquo; daughters were by no means
pleased at this addition to the number of the Ranees;
and they agreed amongst themselves that it would be
highly derogatory to their dignity to permit Guzra Bai
to associate with them, and that the Rajah, their husband,
had offered them an unpardonable insult in
marrying a Malee&rsquo;s daughter, which was to be revenged
upon her the very first opportunity.</p>

<p>Having made this league, they tormented poor
Guzra Bai so much that to save her from their persecutions,
the Rajah built her a little house of her
own, where she lived very, very happily for a short
time.</p>

<p>At last one day he had occasion to go and visit a
distant part of his dominions, but fearing his high-born
wives might ill-use Guzra Bai in his absence, at parting
he gave her a little golden bell,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> saying, &ldquo;If while
I am away you are in any trouble, or any one should
be unkind to you, ring this little bell, and wherever I
am I shall instantly hear it, and will return to your
aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner had the Rajah gone, than Guzra Bai
thought she would try the power of the bell. So she
rang it. The Rajah instantly appeared. &ldquo;What do
you want?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I
was foolish. I could hardly believe what you told me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
could be true, and thought I would try.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now you
will believe, I hope,&rdquo; he said, and went away. A
second time she rang the bell. Again the Rajah returned.
&ldquo;Oh, pardon me, husband,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it
was wrong of me not to trust you, but I hardly thought
you could return again from so far.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;only do not try the experiment again.&rdquo; And
again he went away. A third time she rang the golden
bell. &ldquo;Why do you ring again, Guzra Bai?&rdquo; asked
the Rajah sternly, as for a third time he returned. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know, indeed; indeed I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;but I know not why, I felt so frightened.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Have any of the Ranees been unkind to you?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;No, none,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;in fact, I have
seen none of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are a silly child,&rdquo; said he,
stroking her hair. &ldquo;Affairs of the state call me away.
You must try and keep a good heart till my return;&rdquo;
and for the fourth time he disappeared.</p>

<p>A little while after this, wonderful to relate, Guzra
Bai had a hundred and one children!&mdash;a hundred boys
and one girl. When the Ranees heard this, they said
to each other, &ldquo;Guzra Bai, the Malee&rsquo;s daughter, will
rank higher than us; she will have great power and influence
as mother to the heir to the Raj;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> let us kill
these children, and tell our husband that she is a sorceress;
then will he love her no longer, and his old
affection for us will return.&rdquo; So these twelve wicked
Ranees all went over to Guzra Bai&rsquo;s house. When
Guzra Bai saw them coming, she feared they meant to
do her some harm, so she seized her little golden bell,
and rang, and rang, and rang&mdash;but no Rajah came.
She had called him back so often that he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
believe she really needed his help. And thus the poor
woman was left to the mercy of her implacable enemies.</p>

<p>Now the nurse who had charge of the hundred and
one babies was an old servant of the twelve Ranees,
and moreover a very wicked woman, able and willing
to do whatever her twelve wicked old mistresses ordered.
So when they said to her, &ldquo;Can you kill these
children?&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;Nothing is easier; I will
throw them out upon the dust-heap behind the palace,
where the rats and hawks and vultures will have left
none of them remaining by to-morrow morning.&rdquo; &ldquo;So
be it,&rdquo; said the Ranees. Then the nurse took the hundred
and one little innocent children&mdash;the hundred little
boys and the one little girl&mdash;and threw them behind
the palace on the dust-heap, close to some large rat-holes;
and after that, she and the twelve Ranees placed
a very large stone in each of the babies&rsquo; cradles, and
said to Guzra Bai, &ldquo;Oh, you evil witch in disguise, do
not hope any longer to impose by your arts on the Rajah&rsquo;s
credulity. See, your children have all turned into
stones. See these, your pretty babies!&rdquo;&mdash;and with that
they tumbled the hundred and one stones down in a
great heap on the floor. Then Guzra Bai began to
cry, for she knew it was not true; but what could one
poor woman do against thirteen? At the Rajah&rsquo;s return
the twelve Ranees accused Guzra Bai of being a
witch, and the nurse testified that the hundred and one
children she had charge of had turned into stones, and
the Rajah believed them rather than Guzra Bai, and
he ordered her to be imprisoned for life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a Bandicote<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> had heard the pitiful cries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
of the children, and taking pity on them, dragged them
all, one by one, into her hole, out of the way of kites
and vultures. She then assembled all the Bandicotes
from far and near, and told them what she had done,
begging them to assist in finding food for the children.
Then every day a hundred and one Bandicotes would
come, each bringing a little bit of food in his mouth,
and give it to one of the children; and so day by day
they grew stronger and stronger, until they were able
to run about, and then they used to play of a morning
at the mouth of the Bandicote&rsquo;s hole, running in there
to sleep every night. But one fine day who should
come by but the wicked old nurse! Fortunately, all
the boys were in the hole, and the little girl, who was
playing outside, on seeing her ran in there too, but not
before the nurse had seen her. She immediately went
to the twelve Ranees and related this, saying, &ldquo;I cannot
help thinking some of the children may still be living
in those rat-holes. You had better send and have
them dug out and killed.&rdquo; &ldquo;We dare not do that,&rdquo;
answered they, &ldquo;for fear of causing suspicion; but we
will order some laborers to dig up that ground and
make it into a field, and that will effectually smother
any of the children who may still be alive.&rdquo; This
plan was approved and forthwith carried into execution;
but the good Bandicote, who happened that day
to be out on a foraging expedition in the palace, heard
all about it there, and immediately running home, took
all the children from her hole to a large well some distance
off, where she hid them in the hollows behind
the steps leading down to the well, laying one child
under each step.</p>

<p>Here they would have been quite safe, had not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
Dhobee<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> happened to go down to the well that day to
wash some clothes, taking with him his little girl.
While her father was drawing up water, the child
amused herself running up and down the steps of the
well. Now each time her weight pressed down a step
it gave the child hidden underneath a little squeeze.
All the hundred boys bore this without uttering a
sound; but when the Dhobee&rsquo;s child trod on the step
under which the little girl was hidden, she cried out,
&ldquo;How can you be so cruel to me, trampling on me in
this way? Have pity on me, for I am a little girl as
well as you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the child heard these words proceeding from
the stone, she ran in great alarm to her father, saying,
&ldquo;Father, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter, but something
alive is certainly under those stones. I heard it speak;
but whether it is a Rakshas or an angel or a human
being I cannot tell.&rdquo; Then the Dhobee went to the
twelve Ranees to tell them the wonderful news about
the voice in the well; and they said to each other,
&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s some of Guzra Bai&rsquo;s children; let us send
and have this inquired into.&rdquo; So they sent some people
to pull down the well and see if some evil spirits
were not there.</p>

<p>Then laborers went to pull down the well. Now
close to the well was a little temple dedicated to Gunputti,
containing a small shrine and a little clay image
of the god. When the children felt the well being
pulled down they called out for help and protection to
Gunputti, who took pity on them and changed them
into trees growing by his temple&mdash;a hundred little
mango trees all round in a circle (which were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
hundred little boys), and a little rose bush in the middle,
covered with red and white roses, which was the little
girl.</p>

<p>The laborers pulled down the well, but they found
nothing there but a poor old Bandicote, which they
killed. Then, by order of the twelve wicked Ranees,
they sacrilegiously destroyed the little temple. But they
found no children there either. However, the Dhobee&rsquo;s
mischievous little daughter had gone with her father to
witness the work of destruction, and as they were looking
on, she said, &ldquo;Father, do look at all those funny
little trees; I never remember noticing them here before.&rdquo;
And being very inquisitive, she started off to
have a nearer look at them. There in a circle grew
the hundred little mango trees, and in the centre of all
the little rose bush, bearing the red and white roses.</p>

<p>The girl rushed by the mango trees, who uttered no
words, and running up to the rose bush, began gathering
some of the flowers. At this the rose bush trembled
very much, and sighed and said, &ldquo;I am a little
girl as well as you; how can you be so cruel? You
are breaking all my ribs.&rdquo; Then the child ran back to
her father and said, &ldquo;Come and listen to what the
rose bush says.&rdquo; And the father repeated the news to
the twelve Ranees, who ordered that a great fire should
be made, and the hundred and one little trees be burnt
in it, root and branch, till not a stick remained.</p>

<p>The fire was made, and the hundred and one little
trees were dug up and just going to be put into it,
when Gunputti, taking pity on them, caused a tremendous
storm to come on, which put out the fire and
flooded the country and swept the hundred and one
trees into the river, where they were carried down a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
long, long way by the torrent, until at last the children
were landed, restored to their own shapes, on the river
bank, in the midst of a wild jungle, very far from any
human habitation.</p>

<p>Here these children lived for ten years, happy in
their mutual love and affection. Generally every day
fifty of the boys would go out to collect roots and berries
for their food, leaving fifty at home to take care of
their little sister: but sometimes they put her in some
safe place, and all would go out together for the day;
nor were they ever molested in their excursions by
bear, panther, snake, scorpion, or other noxious creature.
One day all the brothers put their little sister
safely up in a fine shady tree, and went out together to
hunt. After rambling on for some time, they came to
the hut of a savage Rakshas, who in the disguise of an
old woman had lived for many years in the jungle.
The Rakshas, angry at this invasion of her domain, no
sooner saw them than she changed them all into crows.
Night came on, and their little sister was anxiously
awaiting her brothers&rsquo; return, when on a sudden she
heard a loud whirring sound in the air, and round the
tree flocked a hundred black crows, cawing and offering
her berries and roots which they had dug up with
their sharp bills. Then the little sister guessed too
truly what must have happened&mdash;that some malignant
spirit had metamorphosed her brothers into this hideous
shape; and at the sad sight she began to cry.</p>

<p>Time wore on; every morning the crows flew away
to collect food for her and for themselves, and every
evening they returned to roost in the branches of the
high tree where she sat the livelong day, crying as if
her heart would break.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
At last so many bitter tears had she shed that they
made a little stream which flowed from the foot of the
tree right down through the jungle.</p>

<p>Some months after this, one fine day, a young Rajah
from a neighboring country happened to be hunting
in this very jungle; but he had not been very successful.
Toward the close of the day he found himself
faint and weary, having missed his way and lost his
comrades, with no companion save his dogs, who,
being thirsty, ran hurriedly hither and thither in search
of water. After some time, they saw in the distance
what looked like a clear stream: the dogs rushed there
and the tired prince, following them, flung himself
down on the grass by the water&rsquo;s brink, thinking to sleep
there for the night; and, with his hands under his
head, stared up into the leafy branches of the tree above
him. Great was his astonishment to see high up in
the air an immense number of crows, and above them all
a most lovely young girl, who was feeding them with
berries and wild fruits. Quick as thought, he climbed
the tree, and bringing her carefully and gently down,
seated her on the grass beside him, saying, &ldquo;Tell me,
pretty lady, who you are, and how you come to be living
in this dreary palace?&rdquo; So she told him all her
adventures, except that she did not say the hundred
crows were her hundred brothers. Then the Rajah
said, &ldquo;Do not cry any more, fair Princess; you shall
come home with me and be my Ranee, and my father
and mother shall be yours.&rdquo; At this she smiled and
dried her eyes, but quickly added, &ldquo;You will let me
take these crows with me, will you not? for I love
them dearly, and I cannot go away unless they may
come too.&rdquo; &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
bring all the animals in the jungle with you, if you like,
so you will only come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he took her home to his father&rsquo;s house, and the
old Rajah and Ranee wondered much at this jungle
Lady, when they saw her rare beauty, her modest
gentle ways and her queenly grace. Then the young
Rajah told them how she was a persecuted Princess,
and asked their leave to marry her; and because her
loving goodness had won all hearts, they gave their
consent as joyfully as if she had been daughter of the
greatest of Rajahs, and brought with her a splendid
dower; and they called her Draupadi Bai.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Draupadi had some beautiful trees planted in front
of her palace, in which the crows, her brothers, used
to live, and she daily with her own hands boiled a
quantity of rice, which she would scatter for them to
eat as they flocked around her. Now some time after
this, Draupadi Bai had a son, who was called Ramchundra.
He was a very good boy, and his mother
Draupadi Bai used to take him to school every morning,
and go and fetch him home in the evening. But
one day, when Ramchundra was about fourteen years
old, it happened that Draupadi Bai did not go to fetch
him home from school as she was wont; and on his
return he found her sitting under the trees in front of
her palace, stroking the glossy black crows that flocked
around her, and weeping.</p>

<p>Then Ramchundra threw down his bundle of books,
and said to his mother, putting his elbows on her knees,
and looking up in her face, &ldquo;Mammy, dear, tell me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
why you are now crying, and what it is that makes you
so often sad.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, nothing, nothing,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;Yes, dear mother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do tell me. Can I help
you? If I can, I will.&rdquo; Draupadi Bai shook her head.
&ldquo;Alas, no, my son,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you are too young to
help me; and as for my grief, I have never told it to
any one. I cannot tell it to you now.&rdquo; But Ramchundra
continued begging and praying her to tell him,
until at last she did; relating to him all her own and
his uncles&rsquo; sad history; and lastly, how they had been
changed by a Rakshas into the black crows he saw
around him. Then the boy sprang up and said,
&ldquo;Which way did your brothers take when they met
the Rakshas?&rdquo; &ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
he answered, &ldquo;I thought perhaps you might remember
on which side they returned that first night to you,
after being bewitched?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they came
toward the tree from that part of the jungle which lies
in a straight line behind the palace.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo;
cried Ramchundra, joyfully, &ldquo;I also will go there,
and find out this wicked old Rakshas, and learn by
what means they may be disenchanted.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no, my
son,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I cannot let you go: see, I have
lost father and mother, and these my hundred brothers;
and now, if you fall into the Rakshas&rsquo; clutches as well
as they, and are lost to me, what will life have worth
living for?&rdquo; To this he replied, &ldquo;Do not fear for me,
mother; I will be wary and discreet.&rdquo; And going to
his father, he said, &ldquo;Father, it is time I should see
something of the world. I beg you to permit me to
travel and see other lands.&rdquo; The Rajah answered,
&ldquo;You shall go. Tell me what attendants you would
like to accompany you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Give me,&rdquo; said Ramchundra,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
&ldquo;a horse to ride, and a groom to take care of it.&rdquo;
The Rajah consented, and Ramchundra set off riding
toward the jungle; but as soon as he got there, he sent
his horse back by the groom with a message to his
parents, and proceeded alone, on foot.</p>

<p>After wandering about for some time he came upon
a small hut, in which lay an ugly old woman fast
asleep. She had long claws instead of hands, and her
hair hung down all around her in a thick black tangle.
Ramchundra knew, by the whole appearance of the
place, that he must have reached the Rakshas&rsquo; abode
of which he was in search; so, stealing softly in, he sat
down and began shampooing her head. At last the
Rakshas woke up. &ldquo;You dear little boy,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;do not be afraid; I am only a poor old woman, and
will not hurt you. Stay with me, and you shall be my
servant.&rdquo; This she said not from any feeling of kindness
or pity for Ramchundra, but merely because she
thought he might be helpful to her. So the young
Rajah remained in her service, determining to stay
there till he should have learnt from her all that he
wished to know.</p>

<p>Thus one day he said to her, &ldquo;Good mother, what
is the use of all those little jars of water you have arranged
round your house?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;That
water possesses certain magical attributes: if any of it
is sprinkled on people enchanted by me, they instantly
resume their former shape.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;is the use of your wand?&rdquo; &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;has many supernatural powers: for instance,
by simply uttering your wish and waving it in the air,
you can conjure up a mountain, a river or a forest in
a moment of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
Another day Ramchundra said to her, &ldquo;Your hair,
good mother, is dreadfully tangled; pray let me comb
it.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must not touch my hair; it
would be dangerous; for every hair has power to set
the jungle on fire.&rdquo; &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; he asked. She
replied, &ldquo;The least fragment of my hair thrown in the
direction of the jungle would instantly set it in a blaze.&rdquo;
Having learnt all this, one day when it was very hot,
and the old Rakshas was drowsy, Ramchundra begged
leave to shampoo her head, which speedily sent her to
sleep; then, gently pulling out two or three of her
hairs, he got up, and taking in one hand her wand, and
in the other two jars of the magic water, he stealthily
left the hut; but he had not gone far before she woke
up, and instantly divining what he had done, pursued
him with great rapidity. Ramchundra, looking back
and perceiving that she was gaining upon him, waved
the enchanted wand and created a great river, which
suddenly rolled its tumultuous waves between them;
but, quick as thought, the Rakshas swam the river.</p>

<p>Then he turned, and waving the wand again, caused
a high mountain to rise between them; but the Rakshas
climbed the mountain. Nearer she came, and yet
nearer; each time he turned to use the wand and put
obstacles in her way, the delay gave her a few minutes&rsquo;
advantage, so that he lost almost as much as he gained.
Then, as a last resource, he scattered the hairs he had
stolen to the winds, and instantly the jungle on the
hill side, through which the Rakshas was coming, was
set in a blaze; the fire rose higher and higher, the
wicked old Rakshas was consumed by the flames, and
Ramchundra pursued his journey in safety until he
reached his father&rsquo;s palace. Draupadi Bai was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
overjoyed to see her son again, and he led her out into the
garden, and scattered the magic water on the hundred
black crows, which instantly recovered their human
forms, and stood up one hundred fine, handsome young
men.</p>

<p>Then were there rejoicings throughout the country,
because the Ranee&rsquo;s brothers had been disenchanted;
and the Rajah sent out into all neighboring lands to invite
their Rajahs and Ranees to a great feast in honor
of his brothers-in-law.</p>

<p>Among others who came to the feast was the Rajah
Draupadi Bai&rsquo;s father, and the twelve wicked Ranees
his wives.</p>

<p>When they were all assembled, Draupadi arose, and
said to him, &ldquo;Noble sir, we had looked to see your
wife Guzra Bai with you. Pray you tell us wherefore
she has not accompanied you.&rdquo; The Rajah was
much surprised to learn that Draupadi Bai knew anything
about Guzra Bai, and he said, &ldquo;Speak not of
her: she is a wicked woman; it is fit that she should
end her days in prison.&rdquo; But Draupadi Bai and her
husband, and her hundred brothers, rose and said,
&ldquo;We require, O Rajah, that you send home instantly
and fetch hither that much injured lady, which, if you
refuse to do, your wives shall be imprisoned, and you
ignominiously expelled this kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah could not guess what the meaning of this
was, and thought they merely wished to pick a quarrel
with him: but not much caring whether Guzra Bai
came or not, he sent for her as was desired. When
she arrived, her daughter Draupadi Bai, and her hundred
sons, with Draupadi Bai&rsquo;s husband and the young
Ramchundra, went out to the gate to meet her, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
conducted her into the palace with all honor. Then,
standing around her, they turned to the Rajah her husband,
and related to him the story of their lives; how
that they were his children, and Guzra Bai their mother;
how she had been cruelly calumniated by the
twelve wicked Ranees, and they in constant peril of
their lives; but having miraculously escaped many terrible
dangers, still lived to pay him duteous service
and to cheer and support his old age.</p>

<p>At this news the whole company was very much astonished.
The Rajah, overjoyed, embraced his wife
Guzra Bai, and it was agreed that she and their hundred
sons should return with him to his own land,
which accordingly was done. Ramchundra lived very
happily with his father and mother to the day of their
death, when he ascended the throne, and became a
very popular Rajah; and the twelve wicked old Ranees,
who had conspired against Guzra Bai and her
children, were, by order of the Rajah, burnt to death.
Thus truth triumphed in the end; but so unequally is
human justice meted out that the old nurse, who
worked their evil will, and was in fact the most guilty
wretch of all, is said to have lived unpunished, to have
died in the bosom of her family, and to have had as
big a funeral pile as any virtuous Hindoo.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there was a Rajah whose name
was Chandra Rajah,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and he had a learned
Wuzeer or Minister, named Butti. Their mutual love
was so great that they were more like brothers than
master and servant. Neither the Rajah nor the Wuzeer
had any children, and both were equally anxious
to have a son. At last, in one day and one hour, the
wife of the Rajah and the wife of the Wuzeer had each
a little baby boy. They named the Rajah&rsquo;s son Rama,
and the son of the Wuzeer was called Luxman, and
there were great rejoicings at the birth of both. The
boys grew up and loved each other tenderly: they were
never happy unless together; together they went to
daily school, together bathed and played, and they
would not eat except from off one plate. One day,
when Rama Rajah was fifteen years old, his mother,
the Ranee, said to Chandra Rajah: &ldquo;Husband, our
son associates too much with low people; for instance,
he is always at play with the Wuzeer&rsquo;s son, Luxman,
which is not befitting his rank. I wish you would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
endeavor to put an end to their friendship, and find
him better playmates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chandra Rajah replied, &ldquo;I cannot do it: Luxman&rsquo;s
father is my very good friend and Wuzeer, as his
father&rsquo;s father was to my father; let the sons be the
same.&rdquo; This answer annoyed the Ranee, but she said
no more to her husband; she sent, however, for all the
wise people, and seers, and conjurors in the land, and
inquired of them whether there existed no means of
dissolving the children&rsquo;s affection for each other; they
answered they knew of none. At last one old Nautch<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
woman came to the Ranee and said, &ldquo;I can do this
thing you wish, but for it you must give me a great
reward.&rdquo; Then the Ranee gave the old woman an
enormous bag full of gold mohurs,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and said, &ldquo;This I
give you now, and if you succeed in the undertaking I
will give you as much again.&rdquo; So this wicked old
woman disguised herself in a very rich dress, and went
to a garden-house which Chandra Rajah had built for
his son, and where Rama Rajah and Luxman, the
young Wuzeer, used to spend the greater part of their
playtime. Outside the house was a large well and a
fine garden. When the old woman arrived, the two
boys were playing cards together in the garden close
to the well. She drew near, and began drawing water
from it. Rama Rajah looking up, saw her, and said
to Luxman, &ldquo;Go, see who that richly-dressed woman
is, and bring me word.&rdquo; The Wuzeer&rsquo;s son did as he
was bidden, and asked the woman what she wanted.
She answered, &ldquo;Nothing, oh nothing,&rdquo; and nodding
her head went away; then, returning to the Ranee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
she said, &ldquo;I have done as you wished; give me the
promised reward,&rdquo; and the Ranee gave her the second
bag of gold. On Luxman&rsquo;s return, the young Rajah
said to him, &ldquo;What did the woman want?&rdquo; Luxman
answered, &ldquo;She told me she wanted nothing.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is
not true,&rdquo; replied the other, angrily; &ldquo;I feel certain
she must have told you something. Why should she
come here for no purpose? It is some secret which
you are concealing from me; I insist on knowing it.&rdquo;
Luxman vainly protesting his innocence, they quarreled
and then fought, and the young Rajah ran home
very angry to his father. &ldquo;What is the matter, my
son?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I am angry
with the Wuzeer&rsquo;s son. I hate that boy; kill him, and
let his eyes be brought to me in proof of his death, or
I will not eat my dinner.&rdquo; Chandra Rajah was very
much grieved at this, but the young Rajah would eat
no dinner, and at last his father said to the Wuzeer,
&ldquo;Take your son away and hide him, for the boys have
had a quarrel.&rdquo; Then he went out and shot a deer, and
showing its eyes to Rama, said to him, &ldquo;See, my
son, the good Wuzeer&rsquo;s son has by your order been
deprived of life,&rdquo; and Rama Rajah was merry, and ate
his dinner. But a while after he began to miss his kind
playmate; there was nobody he cared for to tell him
stories and amuse him. Then for four nights running
he dreamed of a beautiful Glass Palace, in which dwelt
a Princess white as marble, and he sent for all the wise
people in the kingdom to interpret his dream, but none
could do it; and, thinking upon this fair princess and
his lost friend, he got more and more sad, and said to
himself: &ldquo;There is nobody to help me in this matter.
Ah! if my Wuzeer&rsquo;s son were here now, how quickly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
would he interpret the dream! Oh, my friend, my
friend, my dear lost friend!&rdquo; and when Chandra Rajah,
his father, came in, he said to him: &ldquo;Show me the
grave of Luxman, son of the Wuzeer, that I also may
die there.&rdquo; His father replied, &ldquo;What a foolish boy
you are! You first begged that the Wuzeer&rsquo;s son might
be killed, and now you want to die on his grave. What
is all this about?&rdquo; Rama Rajah replied, &ldquo;Oh, why did
you give the order for him to be put to death? In him
I have lost my friend and all my joy in life; show me
now his grave, for thereon, I swear, will I kill myself.&rdquo;
When the Rajah saw that his son really grieved for the
loss of Luxman, he said to him, &ldquo;You have to thank
me for not regarding your foolish wishes; your old
playmate is living, therefore be friends again, for what
you thought were his eyes were but the eyes of a deer.&rdquo;
So the friendship of Rama and Luxman was resumed
on its former footing. Then Rama said to Luxman,
&ldquo;Four nights ago I dreamed a strange dream. I
thought that for miles and miles I wandered through a
dense jungle, after which I came upon a grove of
Cocoa-nut trees, passing through which I reached one
compound entirely of Guava trees, then one of Soparee<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
trees, and lastly one of Copal trees: beyond this lay a
garden of flowers, of which the Malee&rsquo;s wife gave me
a bunch; round the garden ran a large river, and on
the other side of this I saw a fair palace composed of
transparent glass, and in the centre of it sat the most
lovely Princess I ever saw, white as marble and covered
with rich jewels; at the sight of her beauty I fainted&mdash;and
so awoke. This has happened now four times,
and as yet I have found no one capable of throwing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
any light on the vision.&rdquo; Luxman answered, &ldquo;I can
tell you. There exists a Princess exactly like her you
saw in your dreams, and, if you like, you can go and
marry her.&rdquo; &ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; said Rama; &ldquo;and what
is your interpretation of the dream?&rdquo; The Wuzeer&rsquo;s
son replied, &ldquo;Listen to me, and I will tell you. In a
country very far away from this, in the centre of a great
Rajah&rsquo;s kingdom, there dwells his daughter, a most
fair Princess; she lives in a glass palace. Round this
palace runs a large river, and round the river is a garden
of flowers. Round the garden are four thick groves of
trees&mdash;one of Copal trees, one of Soparee trees, one of
Guava trees, and one of Cocoa-nut trees. The Princess
is twenty-four years old, but she is not married, for she
has determined only to marry whoever can jump this
river and greet her in her crystal palace, and though
many thousand kings have essayed to do so, they have
all perished miserably in the attempt, having either
been drowned in the river, or broken their necks by
falling; thus all that you dreamed of is perfectly true.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Can we go to this country?&rdquo; asked the young Rajah.
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; his friend replied. &ldquo;This is what you must
do. Go tell your father you wish to see the world.
Ask him for neither elephants nor attendants, but beg
him to lend you for the journey his old war-horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this Rama went to his father, and said,
&ldquo;Father, I pray you give me leave to go and travel
with the Wuzeer&rsquo;s son. I desire to see the world.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What would you have for the journey, my son?&rdquo; said
Chandra Rajah; &ldquo;will you have elephants and how
many?&mdash;attendants, how many?&rdquo; &ldquo;Neither, father,&rdquo;
he answered, &ldquo;give me rather, I pray you, your old
war-horse, that I may ride him during the journey.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
&ldquo;So be it, my son,&rdquo; he answered, and with that Rama
Rajah and Luxman set forth on their travels. After
going many, many thousands of miles, to their joy one
day they came upon a dense grove of Cocoa-nut trees,
and beyond that to a grove of Guava trees, then to one
of Soparee trees, and lastly to one of Copal trees; after
which they entered a beautiful garden, where the
Malee&rsquo;s wife presented them with a large bunch of
flowers. Then they knew that they had nearly reached
the place where the fair Princess dwelt. Now it happened
that, because many kings and great people had
been drowned in trying to jump over the river that ran
round the Glass Palace where the Princess lived, the
Rajah, her father, had made a law that, in future, no
aspirants to her hand were to attempt the jump, except
at stated times and with his knowledge and permission,
and that any Rajahs or Princes found wandering there,
contrary to this law, were to be imprisoned. Of this
the young Rajah and the Wuzeer&rsquo;s son knew nothing,
and having reached the centre of the garden they found
themselves on the banks of a large river, exactly opposite
the wondrous Glass Palace, and were just debating
what further steps to take, when they were seized by
the Rajah&rsquo;s guard, and hurried off to prison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a hard fate,&rdquo; said Luxman. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sighed
Rama Rajah; &ldquo;a dismal end, in truth, to all our fine
schemes. Would it be possible, think you, to escape?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; answered Luxman; &ldquo;at all events, I will
try.&rdquo; With that he turned to the sentry who was
guarding them, and said, &ldquo;We are shut in here and
can&rsquo;t get out: here is money for you if you will only
have the goodness to call out that the Malee&rsquo;s Cow has
strayed away.&rdquo; The sentry thought this a very easy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
way of making a fortune; so he called out as he was
bidden, and took the money. The result answered
Luxman&rsquo;s anticipations. The Malee&rsquo;s wife, hearing
the sentry calling out, thought to herself, &ldquo;What,
sentries round the guard-room again! then there must
be prisoners; doubtless they are those two young
Rajahs I met in the garden this morning; at least, I
will endeavor to release them.&rdquo; So she asked two old
beggars to accompany her, and taking with her offerings
of flowers and sweetmeats, started as if to go to a
little temple which was built within the quadrangle
where the prisoners were kept. The sentries, thinking
she was only going with two old friends to visit the
temple, allowed her to pass without opposition. As
soon as she got within the quadrangle she unfastened
the prison door, and told the two young men (Rama
Rajah and Luxman) to change clothes with the two
old beggars, which they instantly did. Then, leaving
the beggars in the cell, she conducted Rama and Luxman
safely to her house. When they had reached it
she said to them, &ldquo;Young Princes, you must know that
you did very wrong in going down to the river before
having made a salaam to our Rajah, and gained his
consent; and so strict is the law on the subject that had
I not assisted your escape, you might have remained a
long time in prison; though, as I felt certain you only
erred through ignorance, I was the more willing to
help you; but to-morrow morning early you must go
and pay your respects at court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next day the guards brought their two prisoners to
the Rajah, saying, &ldquo;See, O King, here are two young
Rajahs whom we caught last night wandering near the
river contrary to your law and commandment.&rdquo; But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
when they came to look at the prisoners, lo and behold!
they were only two old beggars whom everybody
knew and had often seen at the palace gate.</p>

<p>Then the Rajah laughed and said, &ldquo;You stupid fellows,
you have been over vigilant for once; see here
your fine young Rajahs. Don&rsquo;t you yet know the looks
of these old beggars?&rdquo; Whereupon the guards went
away much ashamed of themselves.</p>

<p>Having learnt discretion from the advice of the
Malee&rsquo;s wife, Rama and Luxman went betimes that
morning to call at the Rajah&rsquo;s palace. The Rajah received
them very graciously, but when he heard the
object of the journey he shook his head, and said, &ldquo;My
pretty fellows, far be it from me to thwart your intentions,
if you are really determined to strive to win my
daughter, the Princess Bargaruttee;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> but as a friend I
would counsel you to desist from the attempt. You can
find a hundred Princesses elsewhere willing to marry
you; why, therefore, come here, where already a thousand
Princes as fair as you have lost there lives? Cease
to think of my daughter&mdash;she is a headstrong girl.&rdquo;
But Rama Rajah still declared himself anxious to try
and jump the dangerous river, whereupon the Rajah
unwillingly consented to his attempting to do so, and
caused it to be solemnly proclaimed around the town
that another Prince was going to risk his life, begging
all good men and true to pray for his success. Then
Rama, having dressed gorgeously, and mounted his
father&rsquo;s stout war-horse, put spurs to it and galloped to
the river. Up, up in the air, like a bird, jumped the
good war-horse, right across the river and into the very
centre courtyard of the Glass Palace of the Princess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
Bargaruttee; and, as if ashamed of so poor an exploit,
this feat he accomplished three times. At this the
heart of the Rajah was glad, and he ran and patted
the brave horse, and kissed Rama Rajah, and said,
&ldquo;Welcome, my son-in-law.&rdquo; The wedding took place
amid great rejoicings, with feasts, illuminations and
much giving of presents, and there Rama Rajah and
his wife, the Ranee Bargaruttee, lived happily for some
time. At last, one day Rama Rajah said to his father-in-law,
&ldquo;Sire, I have been very happy here, but I
have a great desire to see my father and my mother,
and my own land again.&rdquo; To which the Rajah replied,
&ldquo;My son, you are free to go; but I have no son
but you, nor daughter but your wife: therefore, as it
grieves me to lose sight of you, come back now and
then to see me and rejoice my heart. My doors are
ever open to you; you will be always welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rama Rajah promised to return occasionally; and
then, being given many rich gifts by the old Rajah, and
supplied with all things needful for the journey, he,
with his beautiful wife Bargaruttee, his friend the
young Wuzeer, and a great retinue, set out to return
home. Before going, Rama Rajah and Luxman richly
rewarded the kind Malee&rsquo;s wife, who had helped them
so ably. On the first evening of their march the travelers
reached the borders of the Cocoa-nut grove, on the
outskirts of the jungle; here they determined to halt
and rest for the night. Rama Rajah and the Ranee
Bargaruttee went to their tent; but Luxman (whose
tender love for them was so great that he usually
watched all night through at their door), was sitting
under a large tree close by, when two little owls flew
over his head, and perching on one of the highest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
branches, began chattering to each other.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The
Wuzeer&rsquo;s son, who was in many ways wiser than most
men, could understand their language. To his surprise
he heard the little lady owl say to her husband,
&ldquo;I wish you would tell me a story, my dear, it is such
a long time since I have heard one.&rdquo; To which her
husband, the other little owl, answered, &ldquo;A story!
what story can I tell you? Do you see these people
encamped under our tree? Would you like to hear
their story?&rdquo; She assented; and he began: &ldquo;See first
this poor Wuzeer; he is a good and faithful man, and
has done much for this young Rajah, but neither has
that been to his advantage heretofore, nor will it be
hereafter.&rdquo; At this Luxman listened more attentively,
and taking out his writing tablets determined to note
down all he heard. The little owl commenced with
the story of the birth of Rama and Luxman, of their
friendship, their quarrel, the young Rajah&rsquo;s dream, and
their reconciliation, and then told of their subsequent
adventures in search of the Princess Bargaruttee, down
to that very day on which they were journeying home.
&ldquo;And what more has Fate in store for this poor
Wuzeer?&rdquo; asked the lady owl. &ldquo;From this place,&rdquo;
replied her husband, &ldquo;he will journey on with the
young Rajah and Ranee, until they get very near
Chandra Rajah&rsquo;s dominions; there, as the whole cavalcade
is about to pass under a large Banyan tree, this
Wuzeer Luxman will notice some of the topmost
branches swaying about in a dangerous manner; he
will hurry the Rajah and Ranee away from it, and the
tree (which would otherwise have inevitably killed
them,) will fall to the ground with a tremendous crash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
but even his having thus saved the Rajah&rsquo;s life shall
not avert his fate.&rdquo; (All this the Wuzeer noted down.)
&ldquo;And what next?&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;what next?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Next,&rdquo; continued the wise little story-teller, &ldquo;next,
just as the Rajah Rama and the Ranee Bargaruttee
and all their suite are passing under the palace door-way,
the Wuzeer will notice that the arch is insecure,
and by dragging them quickly through, prevent their
being crushed in its fall.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what will he do after
that, dear husband?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;After that,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;when the Rajah and Ranee are asleep, and
the Wuzeer Luxman keeping guard over them, he will
perceive a large cobra slowly crawling down the wall
and drawing nearer and nearer to the Ranee. He
will kill it with his sword, but a drop of the cobra&rsquo;s
blood shall fall on the Ranee&rsquo;s white forehead. The
Wuzeer will not dare to wipe the blood off her forehead
with his hand, but shall instead cover his face
with a cloth that he may lick it off with his tongue;
but for this the Rajah will be angry with him, and
his reproaches will turn this poor Wuzeer into
stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he always remain stone?&rdquo; asked the lady owl.
&ldquo;Not for ever,&rdquo; answered the husband, &ldquo;but for eight
long years he will remain so.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what then?&rdquo;
demanded she. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; answered the other, &ldquo;when
the young Rajah and Ranee have a baby, it shall come
to pass that one day the child shall be playing on the
floor, and to help itself along shall clasp hold of the
stony figure, and at that baby&rsquo;s touch the Wuzeer will
come to life again. But I have told you enough for
one night; come, let&rsquo;s catch mice&mdash;tuwhit, tuwhoo,
tuwhoo,&rdquo; and away flew the owls. Luxman had written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
down all he heard, and it made him heavy-hearted,
but he thought, &ldquo;Perhaps, after all, this may not be
true.&rdquo; So he said nothing about it to any living soul.
Next day they continued their journey, and as the owl
had prophesied, so events fell out. For, as the whole
party were passing under a large Banyan tree, the
Wuzeer noticed that it looked unsafe. &ldquo;The owl
spake truly,&rdquo; he thought to himself, and, seizing the
Rajah and Ranee, he hurried them from under it,
just as a huge limb of the tree fell prone with a fearful
crash.</p>

<p>A little while after, having reached Chandra Rajah&rsquo;s
dominions, they were just going under the great arch
of the palace courtyard, when the Wuzeer noticed some
of the stones tottering. &ldquo;The owl was a true prophet,&rdquo;
thought he again, and catching hold of the hands of
Rama Rajah and Bargaruttee Ranee, he pulled them
rapidly through, just in time to save their lives. &ldquo;Pardon
me,&rdquo; he said to the Rajah, &ldquo;that unbidden I dared
thus to touch your hand and that of the Ranee, but I
saw the danger imminent.&rdquo; So they reached home,
where they were joyfully welcomed by Chandra Rajah,
the Ranee, the Wuzeer (Luxman&rsquo;s father), and all the
court.</p>

<p>A few nights afterward, when the Rajah and Ranee
were asleep, and the young Wuzeer keeping guard
over them as he was wont, he saw a large black cobra
stealthily creeping down the wall just above the Ranee&rsquo;s
head. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;then such is my fate,
and so it must be; nevertheless, I will do my duty,&rdquo;
and, taking from the folds of his dress the history of
his and the young Rajah&rsquo;s life, from their boyhood
down to that very time (as he had written it from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
owl&rsquo;s narrative), he laid it beside the sleeping Rama,
and drawing his sword, killed the cobra. A few drops
of the serpent&rsquo;s blood fell on the Ranee&rsquo;s forehead:
the Wuzeer did not dare to touch it with his hand, but,
that her sacred brow might not be defiled with the vile
cobra&rsquo;s blood, he reverently covered his face and mouth
with a cloth to lick the drops of blood away. At this
moment the Rajah started up, and seeing him, said:
&ldquo;O Wuzeer, Wuzeer, is this well done of you? O
Luxman, who have been to me as a brother, who have
saved me from so many difficulties, why do you treat
me thus, to kiss her holy forehead? If indeed you
loved her (as who could help it?), could you not have
told me when we first saw her in that Glass Palace,
and I would have exiled myself that she might be your
wife? O my brother, my brother, why did you mock
me thus?&rdquo; The Rajah had buried his face in his hands;
he looked up, he turned to the Wuzeer, but from him
came neither answer nor reply. He had become a
senseless stone. Then Rama for the first time perceived
the roll of paper which Luxman had laid beside
him, and when he read in it of what Luxman had been
to him from boyhood, and of the end, his bitter grief
broke through all bounds; and, falling at the feet of
the statue, he clasped its stony knees and wept aloud.
When daylight dawned, Chandra Rajah and the Ranee
found Rama still weeping and hugging the stone, asking
its forgiveness with penitent cries and tears. Then
they said to him, &ldquo;What is this you have done?&rdquo;
When he told them, the Rajah his father was very
angry, and said: &ldquo;Was it not enough that you should
have once before unjustly desired the death of this good
man, but that now by your rash reproaches you should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
have turned him into stone? Go to; you do but continually
what is evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now eight long years rolled by without the Wuzeer
returning to his original form, although every day
Rama Rajah and Bargaruttee Ranee would watch beside
him, kissing his cold hands, and adjuring him by
all endearing names to forgive them and return to them
again. When eight years had expired, Rama and
Bargaruttee had a child; and from the time it was
nine months old and first began to try and crawl about,
the father and mother would sit and watch beside it,
placing it near the Wuzeer&rsquo;s statue, in hopes that the
baby would some day touch it as the owl had foretold.</p>

<p>But for three months they watched in vain. At last,
one day when the child was a year old, and was trying
to walk, it chanced to be close to the statue, and tottering
on its unsteady feet, stretched out its tiny hands
and caught hold of the foot of the statue. The Wuzeer
instantly came back to life, and stooping down seized
the little baby who had rescued him in his arms, and
kissed it. It is impossible to describe the delight of
Rama Rajah and his wife at regaining their long-lost
friend. The old Rajah and Ranee rejoiced also, with
the Wuzeer (Luxman Wuzeer&rsquo;s father), and his mother.</p>

<p>Then Chandra Rajah said to the Wuzeer: &ldquo;Here is
my boy happy with his wife and child, while your son
has neither; go fetch him a wife, and we will have a
right merry wedding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Wuzeer of the Rajah fetched for his son
a kind and beautiful wife, and Chandra Rajah and
Rama Rajah caused the wedding of Luxman to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
grander than that of any great Rajah before or since,
even as if he had been a son of the royal house; and
they all lived very happy ever after, as all good
fathers, and mothers, and husbands, and wives, and
children do.</p>

<h2>VI.<br />
<br />
<i>LITTLE SURYA BAI.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> POOR Milkwoman was once going into the town
with cans full of milk to sell. She took with her
her little daughter (a baby of about a year old), having
no one in whose charge to leave her at home. Being
tired, she sat down by the road-side, placing the child
and the cans full of milk beside her; when, on a sudden,
two large eagles flew overhead; and one, swooping
down, seized the child, and flew away with her out
of the mother&rsquo;s sight.</p>

<p>Very far, far away the eagles carried the little baby,
even beyond the borders of her native land, until they
reached their home in a lofty tree. There the old
eagles had built a great nest; it was made of iron and
wood, and was as big as a little house; there was iron
all round, and to get in and out you had to go through
seven iron doors.</p>

<p>In this stronghold they placed the little baby, and
because she was like a young eaglet they called her
Surya Bai (the Sun Lady). The eagles both loved
the child; and daily they flew into distant countries to
bring her rich and precious things&mdash;clothes that had
been made for princesses, precious jewels, wonderful
playthings, all that was most costly and rare.</p>

<p>One day, when Surya Bai was twelve years old, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
old husband Eagle said to his wife, &ldquo;Wife, our daughter
has no diamond ring on her little finger, such as
princesses wear; let us go and fetch her one.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said the other old Eagle; &ldquo;but to fetch it we must go
very far.&rdquo; &ldquo;True,&rdquo; rejoined he, &ldquo;such a ring is not to
be got nearer than the Red Sea, and that is a twelvemonth&rsquo;s
journey from here; nevertheless we will go.&rdquo;
So the Eagles started off, leaving Surya Bai in the
strong nest, with twelve months&rsquo; provisions (that she
might not be hungry whilst they were away), and a
little dog and cat to take care of her.</p>

<p>Not long after they were gone, one day the naughty
little cat stole some food from the store, for doing
which Surya Bai punished her. The cat did not like
being whipped, and she was still more annoyed at
having been caught stealing; so, in revenge, she ran to
the fireplace (they were obliged to keep a fire always
burning in the Eagle&rsquo;s nest, as Surya Bai never went
down from the tree, and would not otherwise have
been able to cook her dinner), and put out the fire.
When the little girl saw this she was much vexed, for
the cat had eaten their last cooked provisions, and she
did not know what they were to do for food. For
three whole days Surya Bai puzzled over the difficulty,
and for three whole days she and the dog and the cat
had nothing to eat. At last she thought she would
climb to the edge of the nest, and see if she could see
any fire in the country below; and, if so, she would go
down and ask the people who lighted it to give her a
little with which to cook her dinner. So she climbed
to the edge of the nest. Then, very far away on the
horizon, she saw a thin curl of blue smoke. So she let
herself down from the tree, and all day long she walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
in the direction whence the smoke came. Toward
evening she reached the place, and found it rose from
a small hut in which sat an old woman warming her
hands over a fire. Now, though Surya Bai did not
know it, she had reached the Rakshas&rsquo; country, and
this old woman was none other than a wicked old
Rakshas, who lived with her son in the little hut. The
young Rakshas, however, had gone out for the day.
When the old Rakshas saw Surya Bai, she was much
astonished, for the girl was beautiful as the sun, and
her rich dress was resplendent with jewels; and she
said to herself, &ldquo;How lovely this child is; what a
dainty morsel she would be! Oh, if my son were only
here we would kill her, and boil her, and eat her. I
will try and detain her till his return.&rdquo; Then, turning
to Surya Bai, she said, &ldquo;Who are you, and what do
you want?&rdquo; Surya Bai answered, &ldquo;I am the daughter
of the great Eagles, but they have gone a far journey,
to fetch me a diamond ring, and the fire has died out
in the nest. Give me, I pray you, a little from your
hearth.&rdquo; The Rakshas replied, &ldquo;You shall certainly
have some, only first pound this rice for me, for I am
old, and have no daughter to help me.&rdquo; Then Surya
Bai pounded the rice, but the young Rakshas had not
returned by the time she had finished; so the old Rakshas
said to her, &ldquo;If you are kind, grind this corn for
me, for it is hard work for my old hands.&rdquo; Then she
ground the corn, but still the young Rakshas came not;
and the old Rakshas said to her, &ldquo;Sweep the house for
me first, and then I will give you the fire.&rdquo; So Surya
Bai swept the house; but still the young Rakshas did
not come.</p>

<p>Then his mother said to Surya Bai, &ldquo;Why should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
you be in such a hurry to go home? fetch me some
water from the well, and then you shall have the fire.&rdquo;
And she fetched the water. When she had done so,
Surya Bai said, &ldquo;I have done all your bidding, now
give me the fire, or I will go elsewhere and seek it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old Rakshas was grieved because her son had
not returned home; but she saw she could detain Surya
Bai no longer, so she said, &ldquo;Take the fire and go in
peace; take also some parched corn, and scatter it
along the road as you go, so as to make a pretty little
pathway from our house to yours,&rdquo;&mdash;and so saying, she
gave Surya Bai several handsful of parched corn. The
girl took them, fearing no evil, and as she went she
scattered the grains on the road. Then she climbed
back into the nest and shut the seven iron doors, and
lighted the fire, and cooked the food, and gave the dog
and the cat some dinner, and took some herself, and
went to sleep.</p>

<p>No sooner had Surya Bai left the Rakshas&rsquo; hut, than
the young Rakshas returned, and his mother said to
him, &ldquo;Alas, alas, my son, why did not you come
sooner? Such a sweet little lamb has been here, and
now we have lost her.&rdquo; Then she told him all about
Surya Bai. &ldquo;Which way did she go?&rdquo; asked the
young Rakshas; &ldquo;only tell me that, and I&rsquo;ll have her
before morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother told him how she had given Surya Bai
the parched corn to scatter on the road; and when he
heard that, he followed up the track, and ran, and ran,
and ran, till he came to the foot of the tree.</p>

<p>There, looking up, he saw the nest high in the
branches above them.</p>

<p>Quick as thought, up he climbed, and reached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
great outer door; and he shook it, and shook it, but
he could not get in, for Surya Bai had bolted it. Then
he said, &ldquo;Let me in, my child, let me in; I&rsquo;m the
great Eagle, and I have come from very far, and
brought you many beautiful jewels; and here is a
splendid diamond ring to fit your little finger.&rdquo; But
Surya Bai did not hear him&mdash;she was fast asleep.</p>

<p>He next tried to force open the door again, but it was
too strong for him. In his efforts, however, he had
broken off one of his finger nails (now the nail of a
Rakshas is most poisonous), which he left sticking in
the crack of the door when he went away.</p>

<p>Next morning Surya Bai opened all the doors, in order
to look down on the world below; but when she came to
the seventh door a sharp thing, which was sticking in it,
ran into her hand, and immediately she fell down dead.</p>

<p>At that same moment the two poor old Eagles returned
from their long twelvemonth&rsquo;s journey, bringing
a beautiful diamond ring, which they had fetched for
their little favorite from the Red Sea.</p>

<p>There she lay on the threshold of the nest, beautiful
as ever, but cold and dead.</p>

<p>The Eagles could not bear the sight; so they placed
the ring on her finger, and then, with loud cries, flew
off to return no more.</p>

<p>But a little while after there chanced to come by a
great Rajah, who was out on a hunting expedition. He
came with hawks, and hounds, and attendants, and
horses, and pitched his camp under the tree in which
the Eagles&rsquo; nest was built. Then looking up, he saw,
amongst the topmost branches, what appeared like a
queer little house; and he sent some of his attendants
to see what it was. They soon returned, and told the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
Rajah that up in the tree was a curious thing like a
cage, having seven iron doors, and that on the threshold
of the first door lay a fair maiden, richly dressed; that
she was dead, and that beside her stood a little dog and
a little cat.</p>

<p>At this the Rajah commanded that they should be
fetched down, and when he saw Surya Bai he felt very
sad to think that she was dead. And he took her hand
to feel if it were already stiff; but all her limbs were
supple, nor had she become cold, as the dead are cold;
and, looking again at her hand, the Rajah saw that a
sharp thing, like a long thorn, had run into the tender
palm, almost far enough to pierce through to the back
of her hand.</p>

<p>He pulled it out, and no sooner had he done so than
Surya Bai opened her eyes, and stood up, crying,
&ldquo;Where am I? and who are you? Is it a dream, or
true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah answered, &ldquo;It is all true, beautiful lady.
I am the Rajah of a neighboring land; pray tell me
who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She replied, &ldquo;I am the Eagles&rsquo; child.&rdquo; But he
laughed. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that cannot be; you are
some great Princess.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I am no
royal lady; what I say is true. I have lived all my life
in this tree. I am only the Eagles&rsquo; child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Rajah said, &ldquo;If you are not a Princess born,
I will make you one, say only you will be my Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surya Bai consented, and the Rajah took her to his
kingdom and made her his Queen. But Surya Bai
was not his only wife, and the first Ranee, his other
wife, was both envious and jealous of her.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
The Rajah gave Surya Bai many trustworthy attendants
to guard her and be with her; and one old woman
loved Surya Bai more than all the rest, and used to say
to her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too intimate with the first Ranee,
dear lady, for she wishes you no good, and she has
power to do you harm. Some day she may poison or
otherwise injure you;&rdquo; but Surya Bai would answer
her, &ldquo;Nonsense! what is there to be alarmed about?
Why cannot we both live happily together like two sisters?&rdquo;
Then the old woman would rejoin, &ldquo;Ah, dear
lady, may you never live to rue your confidence! I
pray my fears may prove folly.&rdquo; So Surya Bai went
often to see the first Ranee, and the first Ranee also
came often to see her.</p>

<p>One day they were standing in the palace courtyard,
near a tank, where the Rajah&rsquo;s people used to bathe,
and the first Ranee said to Surya Bai, &ldquo;What pretty
jewels you have, sister! let me try them on for a minute,
and see how I look in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman was standing beside Surya Bai, and
she whispered to her, &ldquo;Do not lend her your jewels.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hush, you silly old woman,&rdquo; answered she. &ldquo;What
harm will it do?&rdquo; and she gave the Ranee her jewels.
Then the Ranee said, &ldquo;How pretty all your things are!
Do you not think they look well even on me? Let us
come down to the tank; it is as clear as glass, and we
can see ourselves reflected in it, and how these jewels
will shine in the clear water!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman, hearing this, was much alarmed,
and begged Surya Bai not to venture near the tank, but
she said, &ldquo;I bid you be silent; I will not distrust my sister,&rdquo;
and she went down to the tank. Then, when no
one was near, and they were both leaning over, looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
at their reflections in the water, the first Ranee pushed
Surya Bai into the tank, who, sinking under water, was
drowned; and from the place where her body fell there
sprang up a bright golden sunflower.</p>

<p>The Rajah shortly afterward inquired where Surya
Bai was, but nowhere could she be found. Then,
very angry, he came to the first Ranee and said, &ldquo;Tell
me where the child is? You have made away with
her.&rdquo; But she answered, &ldquo;You do me wrong; I know
nothing of her. Doubtless that old woman, whom you
allowed to be always with her, has done her some
harm.&rdquo; So the Rajah ordered the poor old woman to
be thrown into prison.</p>

<p>He tried to forget Surya Bai and all her pretty ways,
but it was no good. Wherever he went he saw her
face. Whatever he heard, he still listened for her voice.
Every day he grew more miserable; he would not eat
or drink; and as for the other Ranee, he could not bear
to speak to her. All his people said, &ldquo;He will surely
die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When matters were in this state, the Rajah one day
wandered to the edge of the tank, and bending over the
parapet, looked into the water. Then he was surprised
to see, growing out of the tank close beside him, a
stately golden flower; and as he watched it, the sunflower
gently bent its head and leaned down toward
him. The Rajah&rsquo;s heart was softened, and he kissed
its leaves and murmured, &ldquo;This flower reminds me of
my lost wife. I love it, it is fair and gentle as she used
to be.&rdquo; And every day he would go down to the tank;
and sit and watch the flower. When the Ranee heard
this, she ordered her servants to go and dig the sunflower
up, and to take it far into the jungle and burn it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
Next time the Rajah went to the tank he found his
flower gone, and he was much grieved, but none dare
say who had done it.</p>

<p>Then, in the jungle, from the place where the ashes
of the sunflower had been thrown, there sprang up a
young mango tree, tall and straight, that grew so
quickly, and became such a beautiful tree, that it was
the wonder of all the country round. At last, on its
topmost bough, came one fair blossom; and the blossom
fell, and the little mango grew rosier and rosier,
and larger and larger, till so wonderful was it both for
size and shape that people flocked from far and near
only to look at it.</p>

<p>But none ventured to gather it, for it was to be kept
for the Rajah himself.</p>

<p>Now one day, the poor Milkwoman, Surya Bai&rsquo;s
mother, was returning homeward after her day&rsquo;s work
with the empty milk cans, and being very tired with
her long walk to the bazaar, she lay down under the
mango tree and fell asleep. Then, right into her
largest milk can, fell the wonderful mango! When
the poor woman awoke and saw what had happened,
she was dreadfully frightened, and thought to herself,
&ldquo;If any one sees me with this wonderful fruit, that all
the Rajah&rsquo;s great people have been watching for so
many, many weeks, they will never believe that I did
not steal it, and I shall be put in prison. Yet it is no
good leaving it here; besides, it fell off of itself into my
milk can. I will therefore take it home as secretly as
possible, and share it with my children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Milkwoman covered up the can in which the
mango was, and took it quickly to her home, where
she placed it in the corner of the room, and put over it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
a dozen other milk cans, piled one above another.
Then, as soon as it was dark, she called her husband
and eldest son (for she had six or seven children), and
said to them, &ldquo;What good fortune do you think has
befallen me to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot guess,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Nothing less,&rdquo;
she went on, &ldquo;than the wonderful, wonderful mango
falling into one of my milk cans while I slept! I have
brought it home with me; it is in that lowest can. Go,
husband, call all the children to have a slice; and you,
my son, take down that pile of cans and fetch me the
mango.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, when he got to the
lowest can, &ldquo;you were joking, I suppose, when you
told us there was a mango here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;there is a mango
there. I put it there myself an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s something quite different now,&rdquo; replied
the son. &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Milkwoman ran to the place, and there, in the
lowest can, she saw, not the mango, but a little tiny
wee lady, richly dressed in red and gold, and no bigger
than a mango! On her head shone a bright jewel
like a little sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is very odd,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;I never
heard of such a thing in my life! But since she has
been sent to us, I will take care of her, as if she were
my own child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every day the little lady grew taller and taller, until
she was the size of an ordinary woman; she was gentle
and lovable, but always sad and quiet, and she
said her name was &ldquo;Surya Bai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children were all very curious to know her history,
but the Milkwoman and her husband would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
let her be teased to tell who she was, and said to the
children, &ldquo;Let us wait. By and by, when she knows
us better, she will most likely tell us her story of her
own accord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that once, when Surya Bai was
taking water from the well for the old Milkwoman, the
Rajah rode by, and as he saw her walking along, he
cried, &ldquo;That is my wife,&rdquo; and rode after her as fast as
possible. Surya Bai hearing a great clatter of horses&rsquo;
hoofs, was frightened, and ran home as fast as possible,
and hid herself; and when the Rajah reached the place
there was only the old Milkwoman to be seen standing
at the door of her hut.</p>

<p>Then the Rajah said to her, &ldquo;Give her up, old
woman, you have no right to keep her; she is mine,
she is mine!&rdquo; But the old woman answered, &ldquo;Are
you mad? I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah replied, &ldquo;Do not attempt to deceive me.
I saw my wife go in at your door; she must be in the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your wife?&rdquo; screamed the old woman&mdash;&ldquo;your
wife? you mean my daughter, who lately returned
from the well! Do you think I am going to give my
child up at your command? You are Rajah in your
palace, but I am Rajah in my own house; and I won&rsquo;t
give up my little daughter for any bidding of yours.
Be off with you, or I&rsquo;ll pull out your beard.&rdquo; And
so saying, she seized a long stick and attacked the
Rajah, calling out loudly to her husband and sons,
who came running to her aid.</p>

<p>The Rajah, seeing matters were against him, and
having outridden his attendants (and not being quite
certain moreover whether he had seen Surya Bai, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
whether she might not have been really the poor Milkwoman&rsquo;s
daughter), rode off and returned to his
palace.</p>

<p>However, he determined to sift the matter. As a
first step he went to see Surya Bai&rsquo;s old attendant, who
was still in prison. From her he learnt enough to make
him believe she was not only entirely innocent of
Surya Bai&rsquo;s death, but gravely to suspect the first
Ranee of having caused it. He therefore ordered the
old woman to be set at liberty, still keeping a watchful
eye on her, and bade her prove her devotion to her
long-lost mistress by going to the Milkwoman&rsquo;s house,
and bringing him as much information as possible
about the family, and more particularly about the girl
he had seen returning from the well.</p>

<p>So the attendant went to the Milkwoman&rsquo;s house,
and made friends with her, and bought some milk, and
afterward she stayed and talked to her.</p>

<p>After a few days the Milkwoman ceased to be suspicious
of her, and became quite cordial.</p>

<p>Surya Bai&rsquo;s attendant then told how she had been
the late Ranee&rsquo;s waiting-woman, and how the Rajah
had thrown her into prison on her mistress&rsquo;s death; in
return for which intelligence the old Milkwoman imparted
to her how the wonderful mango had tumbled
into her can as she slept under the tree, and how it
had miraculously changed in the course of an hour
into a beautiful little lady. &ldquo;I wonder why she should
have chosen my poor house to live in, instead of any
one else&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the old woman.</p>

<p>Then Surya Bai&rsquo;s attendant said, &ldquo;Have you ever
asked her her history? Perhaps she would not mind
telling it to you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
So the Milkwoman called the girl, and as soon as
the old attendant saw her, she knew it was none other
than Surya Bai, and her heart jumped for joy; but she
remained silent, wondering much, for she knew her
mistress had been drowned in the tank.</p>

<p>The old Milkwoman turned to Surya Bai and said,
&ldquo;My child, you have lived long with us, and been a
good daughter to me; but I have never asked you your
history, because I thought it must be a sad one; but
if you do not fear to tell it to me now, I should like to
hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surya Bai answered, &ldquo;Mother, you speak true; my
story is sad. I believe my real mother was a poor
Milkwoman like you, and that she took me with her
one day when I was quite a little baby, as she was
going to sell milk in the bazaar. But being tired with
the long walk, she sat down to rest, and placed me
also on the ground, when suddenly a great Eagle flew
down and carried me away. But all the father and
mother I ever knew were the two great Eagles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my child! my child!&rdquo; cried the Milkwoman,
&ldquo;I was that poor woman; the Eagles flew away with
my eldest girl when she was only a year old. Have I
found you after these many years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she ran and called all her children, and her
husband, to tell them the wonderful news.</p>

<p>Then was there great rejoicing among them all.</p>

<p>When they were a little calmer, her mother said to
Surya Bai, &ldquo;Tell us, dear daughter, how your life has
been spent since first we lost you.&rdquo; And Surya Bai
went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old Eagles took me away to their home, and
there I lived happily many years. They loved to bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
me all the beautiful things they could find, and at last
one day they both went to fetch me a diamond ring
from the Red Sea; but while they were gone the fire
went out in the nest: so I went to an old woman&rsquo;s hut,
and got her to give me some fire; and next day (I
don&rsquo;t know how it was), as I was opening the outer
door of the cage, a sharp thing, that was sticking in it,
ran into my hand and I fell down senseless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long I lay there, but when I
came to myself, I found the Eagles must have come
back, and thought me dead, and gone away, for the
diamond ring was on my little finger; a great many
people were watching over me, and amongst them was
a Rajah, who asked me to go home with him and be
his wife, and he brought me to this place, and I was
his Ranee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But his other wife, the first Ranee, hated me (for
she was jealous), and desired to kill me; and one day
she accomplished her purpose by pushing me into the
tank, for I was young and foolish, and disregarded the
warnings of my faithful old attendant, who begged me
not to go near the place. Ah! if I had only listened
to her words I might have been happy still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words the old attendant, who had been sitting
in the back ground, rushed forward and kissed
Surya Bai&rsquo;s feet, crying, &ldquo;Ah, my lady! my lady!
have I found you at last!&rdquo; and, without staying to hear
more, she ran back to the palace to tell the Rajah the
glad news.</p>

<p>Then Surya Bai told her parents how she had not
wholly died in the tank, but became a sunflower; and
how the first Ranee, seeing how fond the Rajah was
of the plant, had caused it to be thrown away; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
then how she had risen from the ashes of the sunflower,
in the form of a mango tree; and how when the tree
blossomed all her spirit went into the little mango
flower, and she ended by saying: &ldquo;And when the
flower became fruit, I know not by what irresistible
impulse I was induced to throw myself into your milk
can. Mother, it was my destiny, and as soon as you
took me into your house, I began to recover my human
form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; asked her brothers and sisters, &ldquo;why
do you not tell the Rajah that you are living, and that
you are the Ranee Surya Bai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I could not do that. Who
knows but that he may be influenced by the first Ranee,
and also desire my death. Let me rather be poor like
you, but safe from danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then her mother cried, &ldquo;Oh, what a stupid woman
I am! The Rajah one day came seeking you here, but
I and your father and brothers drove him away, for we
did not know you were indeed the lost Ranee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke these words a sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs
was heard in the distance, and the Rajah himself appeared,
having heard the good news of Surya Bai&rsquo;s
being alive from her old attendant.</p>

<p>It is impossible to tell the joy of the Rajah at finding
his long-lost wife, but it was not greater than Surya
Bai&rsquo;s at being restored to her husband.</p>

<p>Then the Rajah turned to the old Milkwoman and
said, &ldquo;Old woman, you did not tell me true, for it was
indeed my wife who was in your hut.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Protector
of the Poor,&rdquo; answered the old Milkwoman,
&ldquo;but it was also my daughter.&rdquo; Then they told him
how Surya Bai was the Milkwoman&rsquo;s child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
At hearing this the Rajah commanded them all to
return with him to the palace. He gave Surya Bai&rsquo;s
father a village, and ennobled the family; and he said
to Surya Bai&rsquo;s old attendant, &ldquo;For the good service
you have done you shall be palace housekeeper,&rdquo; and
he gave her great riches; adding, &ldquo;I can never repay
the debt I owe you, nor make you sufficient recompense
for having caused you to be unjustly cast into
prison.&rdquo; But she replied, &ldquo;Sire, even in your anger
you were temperate; if you had caused me to be put
to death, as some would have done, none of this good
might have come upon you; it is yourself you have to
thank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wicked first Ranee was cast, for the rest of her
life, into the prison in which the old attendant had been
thrown; but Surya Bai lived happily with her husband
the rest of her days; and in memory of her adventures,
he planted round their palace a hedge of sunflowers
and a grove of mango trees.</p>

<h2>VII.<br />
<br />
<i>THE WANDERINGS OF VICRAM MAHARAJAH.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once upon a time a Rajah named
Vicram Maharajah,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> who had a Wuzeer named
Butti.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Both the Rajah and his minister were left orphans
when very young, and ever since their parents&rsquo;
death they had lived together: they were educated together,
and they loved each other tenderly&mdash;like brothers.</p>

<p>Both were good and kind&mdash;no poor man coming to
the Rajah was ever known to have been sent away disappointed,
for it was his delight to give food and clothes
to those in need. But whilst the Wuzeer had much
judgment and discretion, as well as a brilliant fancy, the
Rajah was too apt to allow his imagination to run away
with his reason.</p>

<p>Under their united rule, however, the kingdom prospered
greatly. The Rajah was the spur of every noble
work, and the Wuzeer the curb to every rash or impracticable
project.</p>

<p>In a country some way from Rajah Vicram&rsquo;s there
lived a little Queen, called Anar Ranee (the Pomegranate
Queen). Her father and mother reigned over
the Pomegranate country, and for her they had made
a beautiful garden. In the middle of the garden
was a lovely pomegranate tree, bearing three large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
pomegranates. They opened in the centre, and in each
was a little bed. In one of them Anar Ranee used to
sleep, and in the pomegranates on either side slept two
of her maids.</p>

<p>Every morning early the pomegranate tree would
gently bend its branches to the ground, and the fruit
would open, and Anar Ranee and her attendants creep
out to play under the shadow of the cool tree until the
evening; and each evening the tree again bent down to
enable them to get into their tiny, snug bed-rooms.</p>

<p>Many princes wished to marry Anar Ranee, for she
was said to be the fairest lady upon earth: her hair was
black as a raven&rsquo;s wing, her eyes like the eyes of a gazelle,
her teeth two rows of exquisite pearls, and her
cheeks the color of the rosy pomegranate. But her
father and mother had caused her garden to be hedged
around with seven hedges made of bayonets, so that
none could go in or out; and they had published a
decree that none should marry her but he who could
enter the garden and gather the three pomegranates, in
which she and her two maids slept. To do this, kings,
princes and nobles innumerable had striven, but striven
in vain.</p>

<p>Some never got past the first sharp hedge of bayonets;
others, more fortunate, surmounted the second,
the third, the fourth, the fifth, or even the sixth; but
there perished miserably, being unable to climb the
seventh. None had ever succeeded in entering the
garden.</p>

<p>Before Vicram Maharajah&rsquo;s father and mother died,
they had built, some way from their palace, a very
beautiful temple. It was of marble, and in the centre
stood an idol made of pure gold. But in course of time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
the jungle had grown up round it, and thick straggling
plants of prickly pear had covered it, so that it was difficult
even to find out whereabouts it was.</p>

<p>Then, one day, the Wuzeer Butti said to Vicram
Maharajah, &ldquo;The temple your father and mother built
at so much pains and cost is almost lost in the jungle,
and will probably ere long be in ruins. It would be a
pious work to find it out and restore it.&rdquo; Vicram Maharajah
agreed, and immediately sent for many workmen,
and caused the jungle to be cut down and the
temple restored. All were much astonished to find
what a beautiful place it was! The floor was white
marble, the walls exquisitely carved in bas-reliefs and
gorgeously colored, while all over the ceiling was
painted Vicram Maharajah&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s name, and in the
centre was a golden image of Gunputti, to whom it was
dedicated.</p>

<p>The Rajah Vicram was so pleased with the beauty
of the place that on that account, as well as because of
its sanctity, he and Butti used to go and sleep there
every night.</p>

<p>One night Vicram had a wonderful dream. He
dreamed his father appeared to him and said, &ldquo;Arise,
Vicram, go to the tower for lights<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> which is in front
of this temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(For there was in front of the temple a beautiful tower
or pyramid for lights, and all the way up it were projections
on which to place candles on days dedicated to
the idol; so that when the whole was lighted it looked
like a gigantic candlestick, and to guard it there were
around it seven hedges made of bayonets.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arise, Vicram, therefore,&rdquo; said the vision; &ldquo;go to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
the tower for lights; below it is a vast amount of
treasure, but you can only get it in one way without incurring
the anger of Gunputti. You must first do in his
honor an act of very great devotion, which if he graciously
approve, and consent to preserve your life
therein, you may with safety remove the treasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is this act of devotion?&rdquo; asked Vicram
Maharajah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is this,&rdquo; (he thought his father answered): &ldquo;You
must fasten a rope to the top of the tower, and to the
other end of the rope attach a basket, into which you
must get head downward, then twist the rope by which
the basket is hung three times, and as it is untwisting,
cut it, when you will fall head downward to the
earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you fall on either of the hedges of bayonets, you
will be instantly killed; but Gunputti is merciful&mdash;do
not fear that he will allow you to be slain. If you escape
unhurt, you will know that he has accepted your
pious act, and may without danger take the treasure.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The vision faded; Vicram saw no more, and shortly
afterward he awoke.</p>

<p>Then, turning to the Wuzeer, he said, &ldquo;Butti, I had
a strange dream. I dreamed my father counseled me
to do an act of great devotion; nothing less than fastening
a basket by a rope to the top of the tower for lights,
and getting into it head downward, then cutting the
rope and allowing myself to fall; by which having propitiated
the divinity, he promised me a vast treasure, to
be found by digging under the tower! What do you
think I had better do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My advice,&rdquo; answered the Wuzeer, &ldquo;is, if you care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
to seek the treasure, to do entirely as your father commanded,
trusting in the mercy of Gunputti.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Rajah caused a basket to be fastened by a
rope to the top of the tower, and got into it head downward;
then he called out to Butti, &ldquo;How can I cut
the rope?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing is easier,&rdquo; answered he; &ldquo;take
this sword in your hand. I will twist the rope three
times, and as it untwists for the first time let the sword
fall upon it.&rdquo; Vicram Maharajah took the sword, and
Butti twisted the rope, and as it first began to untwist,
the Rajah cut it, and the basket immediately fell. It
would have certainly gone down among the bayonets,
and he been instantly killed, had not Gunputti, seeing
the danger of his devotee, rushed out of the temple at
that moment in the form of an old woman, who, catching
the basket in her arms before it touched the bayonets,
brought it gently and safely to the ground; having
done which she instantly returned into the temple.
None of the spectators knew she was Gunputti himself
in disguise; they only thought &ldquo;What a clever old
woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vicram Maharajah then caused excavations to be
made below the tower, under which he found an immense
amount of treasure. There were mountains of
gold, there were diamonds, and rubies, and sapphires,
and emeralds, and turquoises, and pearls; but he took
none of them, causing all to be sold and the money
given to the poor, so little did he care for the riches for
which some men sell their bodies and souls.</p>

<p>Another day, the Rajah, when in the temple, dreamed
again. Again his father appeared to him, and this time
he said, &ldquo;Vicram, come daily to this temple and Gunputti
will teach you wisdom, and you shall get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
understanding. You may get learning in the world, but
wisdom is the fruit of much learning and much experience,
and much love to God and man; wherefore,
come, acquire wisdom, for learning perishes, but wisdom
never dies.&rdquo; When the Rajah awoke, he told his
dream to the Wuzeer, and Butti recommended him to
obey his father&rsquo;s counsel, which he accordingly did.</p>

<p>Daily he resorted to the temple and was instructed
by Gunputti; and when he had learnt much, one day
Gunputti said to him, &ldquo;I have given you as much wisdom
as is in keeping with man&rsquo;s finite comprehension;
now, as a parting gift, ask of me what you will and it
shall be yours&mdash;or riches, or power, or beauty, or long
life, or health, or happiness&mdash;choose what you will
have?&rdquo; The Rajah was very much puzzled, and he
begged leave to be allowed a day to think over the
matter, and decide what he would choose, to which
Gunputti assented.</p>

<p>Now it happened that near the palace there lived the
son of a Carpenter, who was very cunning, and when
he heard that the Rajah went to the temple to learn
wisdom, he also determined to go and see if he could
not learn it also; and each day, when Gunputti gave
Vicram Maharajah instruction, the Carpenter&rsquo;s son
would hide close behind the temple, and overhear all
their conversation; so that he also became very wise.
No sooner, therefore, did he hear Gunputti&rsquo;s offer to
Vicram than he determined to return again when the
Rajah did, and find out in what way he was to procure
the promised gift, whatever it was.</p>

<p>The Rajah consulted Butti as to what he should ask
for, saying, &ldquo;I have riches more than enough; I have
also sufficient power, and for the rest I had sooner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
take my chance with other men, which makes me
much at a loss to know what to choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wuzeer answered, &ldquo;Is there any supernatural
power you at all desire to possess? If so, ask for that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Rajah, &ldquo;it has always been a great
desire of mine to have power to leave my own body
when I will, and translate my soul and sense into some
other body, either of man or animal. I would rather
be able to do that than anything else.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said
the Wuzeer, &ldquo;ask Gunputti to give you the power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next morning the Rajah, having bathed and prayed,
went in great state to the temple to have his final interview
with the idol. And the Carpenter&rsquo;s son went too,
in order to overhear it.</p>

<p>Then Gunputti said to the Rajah, &ldquo;Vicram, what
gift do you choose?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, divine Power,&rdquo; answered
the Rajah, &ldquo;you have already given me a sufficiency
of wealth and power, in making me Rajah; neither
care I for more of beauty than I now possess; and of
long life, health and happiness I had rather take my
share with other men. But there is a power which I
would rather own than all that you have offered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name it, O good son of a good father,&rdquo; said
Gunputti.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most Wise,&rdquo; replied Vicram, &ldquo;give me the power
to leave my own body when I will, and translate my
soul, and sense, and thinking powers into any other
body that I may choose, either of man, or bird, or
beast&mdash;whether for a day, or a year, or for twelve
years, or as long as I like; grant also, that however
long the term of my absence, my body may not decay,
but that, when I please to return to it again, I may find
it still as when I left it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
&ldquo;Vicram,&rdquo; answered Gunputti, &ldquo;your prayer is
heard,&rdquo; and he instructed Vicram Maharajah by what
means he should translate his soul into another body,
and also gave him something which, being placed
within his own body when he left it, would preserve it
from decay until his return.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The Carpenter&rsquo;s son, who had been all this time
listening outside the temple, heard and learnt the spell
whereby Gunputti gave Vicram Maharajah power to
enter into any other body; but he could not see nor find
out what was given to the Rajah to place within his
own body when he left it, to preserve it; so that he
was only master of half the secret.</p>

<p>Vicram Maharajah returned home, and told the
Wuzeer that he was possessed of the much-desired
secret. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Butti, &ldquo;the best use you can
put it to is to fly to the Pomegranate country, and
bring Anar Ranee here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can that be done?&rdquo; asked the Rajah. &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo;
replied Butti; &ldquo;transport yourself into the body of a
parrot, in which shape you will be able to fly over the
seven hedges of bayonets that surround her garden.
Go to the tree in the centre of it, bite off the stalks
of the pomegranates and bring them home in your
beak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Rajah, and he picked up a
parrot which lay dead on the ground, and placing
within his own body the beauty-preserving charm, transported
his soul into the parrot, and flew off.</p>

<p>On, on, on he went, over the hills and far away, until
he came to the garden. Then he flew over the seven
hedges of bayonets, and with his beak broke off the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
three pomegranates (in which were Anar Ranee and her
two ladies), and holding them by the stalks brought
them safely home. He then immediately left the parrot&rsquo;s
body and re-entered his own body.</p>

<p>When Butti saw how well he had accomplished the
feat, he said, &ldquo;Thank heaven! there&rsquo;s some good done
already.&rdquo; All who saw Anar Ranee were astonished
at her beauty, for she was fair as a lotus flower, and the
color on her cheeks was like the deep rich color of a
pomegranate, and all thought the Rajah very wise to
have chosen such a wife.</p>

<p>They had a magnificent wedding, and were for a
short time as happy as the day is long.</p>

<p>But within a little while Vicram Maharajah said to
Butti, &ldquo;I have again a great desire to see the world.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Butti, &ldquo;so soon again to leave your
home! So soon to care to go away from your young
wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love her and my people dearly,&rdquo; answered the
Rajah; &ldquo;but I cannot but feel that I have this supernatural
power of taking any form I please, and longing
to use it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where and how will you go?&rdquo; asked the
Wuzeer. &ldquo;Let it be the day after to-morrow,&rdquo; answered
Vicram Maharajah. &ldquo;I shall again take the
form of a parrot, and see as much of the world as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it was settled that the Rajah should go. He left
his kingdom in the Wuzeer&rsquo;s sole charge, and also his
wife, saying to her, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for how long I may
be away; perhaps a day, perhaps a year, perhaps more.
But if, while I am gone, you should be in any difficulty,
apply to the Wuzeer. He has ever been like an elder
brother or a father to me; do you therefore also regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
him as a father. I have charged him to take care of
you as he would of his own child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having said these words, the Rajah caused a beautiful
parrot to be shot (it was a very handsome bird, with
a tuft of bright feathers on its head and a ring about
its neck). He then cut a small incision in his arm and
rubbed into it some of the magic preservative given
him by Gunputti to keep his body from decaying, and
transporting his soul into the parrot&rsquo;s body, he flew
away.</p>

<p>No sooner did the Carpenter&rsquo;s son hear that the Rajah
was as dead, than, knowing the power of which
Vicram Maharajah and he were alike possessed, he felt
certain that the former had made use of it, and determined
himself likewise to turn it to account. Therefore,
directly the Rajah entered the parrot&rsquo;s body, the
Carpenter&rsquo;s son entered the Rajah&rsquo;s body, and the world
at large imagined that the Rajah had only swooned
and recovered. But the Wuzeer was wiser than they,
and immediately thought to himself, &ldquo;Some one beside
Vicram Maharajah must have become acquainted with
this spell, and be now making use of it, thinking it
would be very amusing to play the part of Rajah for a
while; but I&rsquo;ll soon discover if this be the case or no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he called Anar Ranee and said to her, &ldquo;You are
as well assured as I am that your husband left us but
now, in the form of a parrot; but scarcely had he gone
before his deserted body arose, and he now appears
walking about, and talking, and as much alive as ever;
nevertheless, my opinion is, that the spirit animating
the body is not the spirit of the Rajah, but that some
one else is possessed of the power given to him by Gunputti,
and has taken advantage of it to personate him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
But this it would be better to put to the proof. Do,
therefore, as I tell you, that you may be assured of the
truth of my words. Make to-day for your husband&rsquo;s
dinner some very coarse and common currie, and give
it to him. If he complains that it is not as good as
usual, I am making a mistake; but if, on the contrary,
he says nothing about it, you will know that my words
are true, and that he is not Vicram Maharajah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anar Ranee did as the Wuzeer advised, and afterward
came to him and said, &ldquo;Father&rdquo; (for so she
always called him), &ldquo;I have been much astonished at
the result of the trial. I made the currie very carelessly,
and it was as coarse and common as possible;
but the Rajah did not even complain. I feel convinced
it is as you say; but what can we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will not,&rdquo; answered the Wuzeer, &ldquo;cast him
into prison, since he inhabits your husband&rsquo;s body; but
neither you, nor any of the Rajah&rsquo;s relations, must have
any friendship with, or so much as speak to him; and
if he speak to any of you, let whoever it be, immediately
begin to quarrel with him, whereby he will find
the life of a rajah not so agreeable as he anticipated,
and may be induced the sooner to return to his proper
form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anar Ranee instructed all her husband&rsquo;s relations and
friends as Butti had advised, and the Carpenter&rsquo;s son began
to think the life of a rajah not at all as pleasant as
he had fancied, and would, if he could, have gladly returned
to his own body again; but, having no power to
preserve it, his spirit had no sooner left it than it began
to decay, and at the end of three days it was quite destroyed;
so that the unhappy man had no alternative but
to remain where he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
Meantime, the real Vicram Maharajah had flown, in
the form of a parrot, very far, far away, until he reached
a large banyan tree, where there were a thousand other
pretty pollies, whom he joined, making their number a
thousand and one. Every day the parrots flew away to
get food, and every night they returned to roost in the
great banyan tree.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that a hunter had often gone through
that part of the jungle, and noticed the banyan tree and
the parrots, and he said to himself, &ldquo;If I could only
catch the thousand and one parrots that nightly roost in
that tree, I should not be so often hungry as I am now,
for they would make plenty of very nice currie.&rdquo; But
he could not do it, though he often tried; for the trunks
of the tree were tall and straight, and very slippery, so
that he no sooner climbed up a little way than he slid
down again: however, he did not cease to look and
long.</p>

<p>One day, a heavy shower of rain drove all the parrots
back earlier than usual to their tree, and when they
got there they found a thousand crows who had come
on their homeward flight to shelter themselves there
till the storm was over.</p>

<p>Then Vicram Maharajah Parrot said to the other
parrots, &ldquo;Do you not see these crows have all sorts of
seeds and fruits in their beaks, which they are carrying
home to their little ones? Let us quickly drive them
away, lest some of these fall down under our tree,
which, being sown there, will spring up strong plants
and twine round the trunks, and enable our enemy the
hunter to climb up with ease and kill us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the other parrots answered, &ldquo;That is a very far-fetched
idea! Do not let us hunt the poor birds away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
from shelter in this pouring rain, they will get so wet.&rdquo;
So the crows were not molested. It turned out, however,
just as Vicram Maharajah had foretold; for some
of the fruits and seeds they were taking home to their
young ones fell under the tree, and the seeds took root
and sprang up, strong creeping plants, which twined
all round the straight trunks of the banyan tree, and
made it very easy to climb.</p>

<p>Next time the hunter came by he noticed this, and
saying, &ldquo;Ah, my fine friends, I&rsquo;ve got you at last,&rdquo; he,
by the help of the creepers, climbed the tree, and set
one thousand and one snares of fine thread among the
branches; having done which he went away.</p>

<p>That night, when the parrots flew down on the
branches as usual, they found themselves all caught
fast prisoners by the feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crick! crick! crick!&rdquo; cried they, &ldquo;crick! crick!
crick! Oh dear! oh dear! what shall we do? what
can we do? Oh, Vicram Maharajah, you were right
and we were wrong. Oh dear! oh dear! crick! crick!
crick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Vicram said, &ldquo;Did I not tell you how it would
be? But do as I bid you, and we may yet be saved.
So soon as the hunter comes to take us away, let every
one hang his head down on one side, as if he were
dead; then, thinking us dead, he will not trouble himself
to wring our necks, or stick the heads of those he
wishes to keep alive through his belt, as he otherwise
would; but will merely release us, and throw us on
the ground. Let each one when there, remain perfectly
still, till the whole thousand and one are set free,
and the hunter begins to descend the tree; then we
will all fly up over his head and far out of sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
The parrots agreed to do as Vicram Maharajah
Parrot proposed, and when the hunter came next
morning to take them away, every one had his eyes
shut and his head hanging down on one side, as if he
were dead. Then the hunter said, &ldquo;All dead, indeed!
Then I shall have plenty of nice currie.&rdquo; And so saying,
he cut the noose that held the first, and threw him
down. The parrot fell like a stone to the ground, so
did the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth,
the seventh, the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, and so
on&mdash;up to the thousandth parrot. Now the thousandth
and first chanced to be none other than Vicram; all
were released but he. But, just as the hunter was
going to cut the noose round his feet, he let his knife
fall, and had to go down and pick it up again. When
the thousand parrots who were on the ground, heard
him coming down, they thought, &ldquo;The thousand and
one are all released, and here comes the hunter; it is
time for us to be off.&rdquo; And with one accord they flew
up into the air and far out of sight, leaving poor Vicram
Maharajah still a prisoner.</p>

<p>The hunter, seeing what had happened, was very
angry, and seizing Vicram, said to him, &ldquo;You wretched
bird! it&rsquo;s you that have worked all this mischief. I
know it must be, for you are a stranger here, and different
to the other parrots. I&rsquo;ll strangle you, at all
events&mdash;that I will.&rdquo; But to his surprise, the parrot
answered him, &ldquo;Do not kill me. What good will that
do you? Rather sell me in the next town. I am very
handsome. You will get a thousand gold mohurs<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand gold mohurs!&rdquo; answered the hunter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
much astonished. &ldquo;You silly bird, who&rsquo;d be so foolish
as to give a thousand gold mohurs for a parrot?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Vicram, &ldquo;only take me and
try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the hunter took him into the town, crying &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll
buy? who&rsquo;ll buy? Come buy this pretty polly that can
talk so nicely. See how handsome he is&mdash;see what a
great red ring he has round his neck. Who&rsquo;ll buy?
who&rsquo;ll buy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then several people asked how much he would take
for the parrot; but when he said a thousand gold mohurs,
they all laughed and went away, saying &ldquo;None
but a fool would give so much for a bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the hunter got angry, and he said to Vicram,
&ldquo;I told you how it would be. I shall never be able to
sell you.&rdquo; But he answered, &ldquo;Oh yes, you will. See
here comes a merchant down this way; I dare say he
will buy me.&rdquo; So the hunter went to the merchant
and said to him, &ldquo;Pray, sir, buy my pretty parrot.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How much do you want for him?&rdquo; asked the merchant&mdash;&ldquo;two
rupees?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered the
hunter; &ldquo;I cannot part with him for less than a thousand
gold mohurs.&rdquo; &ldquo;A thousand gold mohurs!&rdquo;
cried the merchant, &ldquo;a thousand gold mohurs! I never
heard of such a thing in my life! A thousand gold
mohurs for one little wee polly! Why, with that sum
you might buy a house, or gardens, or horses, or ten
thousand yards of the best cloth. Who&rsquo;s going to give
you such a sum for a parrot? Not I, indeed. I&rsquo;ll give
you two rupees and no more.&rdquo; But Vicram called
out, &ldquo;Merchant, merchant, do not fear to buy me. I
am Vicram Maharajah Parrot. Pay what the hunter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
asks, and I will repay it to you&mdash;buy me only, and I
will keep your shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Polly,&rdquo; answered the merchant, &ldquo;what nonsense
you talk!&rdquo; But he took a fancy to the bird, and paid
the hunter a thousand gold mohurs, and taking Vicram
Maharajah home, hung him up in his shop.</p>

<p>Then the Parrot took on him the duties of shopman,
and talked so much and so wisely that every one in
the town soon heard of the merchant&rsquo;s wonderful bird.
Nobody cared to go to any other shop&mdash;all came to his
shop, only to hear the Parrot talk; and he sold them
what they wanted, and they did not care how much he
charged for what he sold, but gave him whatever he
asked; insomuch, that in one week the merchant had
made a thousand gold mohurs over and above his usual
weekly profits; and there Vicram Maharajah Parrot
lived for a long time, made much of by everybody, and
very happy.</p>

<p>It happened in the town where the merchant lived
there was a very accomplished Nautch girl,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> named
Champa Ranee.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> She danced so beautifully that the
people of the town used always to send for her to dance
on the occasion of any great festival.</p>

<p>There also lived in the town a poor wood-cutter,
who earned his living by going out far into the jungle
to cut wood, and bringing it in every day, into the
bazaar to sell.</p>

<p>One day he went out as usual into the jungle to cut
wood, and being tired, he fell asleep under a tree and
began to dream; and he dreamed that he was a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
rich man, and that he married the beautiful Nautch
girl, and that he took her home to his house, and gave
his wife, as a wedding present, a thousand gold
mohurs!</p>

<p>When he went into the bazaar that evening as usual
to sell wood, he began telling his dream to his friends,
saying, &ldquo;While I was in the jungle I had such an absurd
dream; I dreamed that I was a rich man, and
that I married the Champa Ranee, and gave her as a
wedding present a thousand gold mohurs!&rdquo; &ldquo;What
a funny dream!&rdquo; they cried, and thought no more of
it.</p>

<p>But it happened that the house under which he was
standing whilst talking to his friends was Champa
Ranee&rsquo;s house, and Champa Ranee herself was near
the window, and heard what he said, and thought to
herself, &ldquo;For all that man looks so poor, he has then
a thousand gold mohurs, or he would not have dreamed
of giving them to his wife; if that is all, I&rsquo;ll go to law
about it, and see if I can&rsquo;t get the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she sent out her servants and ordered them to
catch the poor wood-cutter; and when they caught
him, she began crying out, &ldquo;Oh husband! husband!
here have I been waiting ever so long, wondering
what has become of you; where have you been all this
time?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what
you mean. You&rsquo;re a great lady and I&rsquo;m a poor wood-cutter;
you must mistake me for somebody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she answered, &ldquo;Oh no! don&rsquo;t you remember we
were married on such and such a day! Have you forgotten
what a grand wedding it was, and you took me
home to your palace, and promised to give me as a
wedding present a thousand gold mohurs? But you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
quite forgot to give me the money, and you went away,
and I returned to my father&rsquo;s house till I could learn
tidings of you; how can you be so cruel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor wood-cutter thought he must be dreaming,
but all Champa Ranee&rsquo;s friends and relations declared
that what she said was true. Then, after much quarreling,
they said they would go to law about it; but
the judge could not settle the matter, and referred it to
the Rajah himself. The Rajah was no less puzzled
than the judge. The wood-cutter protested that he
was only a poor wood-cutter; but Champa Ranee and
her friends asserted that he was, on the contrary, a rich
man, her husband, and had had much money, which
he must have squandered. She offered, however, to
give up all claim to that, if he would only give her a
thousand gold mohurs, which he had promised; and so
suggested a compromise. The wood-cutter replied
that he would gladly give the gold mohurs if he had
them; but that (as he brought witnesses to prove) he
was really and truly what he professed to be&mdash;only a
poor wood-cutter, who earned two annas<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> a day cutting
wood, and had neither palace nor riches nor wife
in the world! The whole city was interested in this
curious case, and all wondered how it would end;
some being sure one side was right, and some equally
certain of the other.</p>

<p>The Rajah could make nothing of the matter, and
at last he said: &ldquo;I hear there is a merchant in this town
who has a very wise parrot, wiser than most men are;
let him be sent for to decide this business, for it is beyond
me; we will abide by his decision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Vicram Maharajah Parrot was sent for, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
placed in the court of justice, to hear and judge the
case.</p>

<p>First he said to the wood-cutter, &ldquo;Tell me your version
of the story.&rdquo; And the wood-cutter answered,
&ldquo;Polly, Sahib, what I tell is true. I am a poor man.
I live in the jungle, and earn my living by cutting
wood and selling it in the bazaar. I never get more
than two annas a day. One day I fell asleep and
dreamed a silly dream&mdash;how I had become rich and
married the Champa Ranee, and had given her as a
wedding present a thousand gold mohurs; but it is no
more true that I owed her a thousand gold mohurs, or
have them to pay, than that I married her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is enough,&rdquo; said Vicram Maharajah. &ldquo;Now,
dancing girl, tell us your story.&rdquo; And Champa
Ranee gave her version of the matter. Then the Parrot
said to her, &ldquo;Tell me now where was the house of
this husband of yours, to which he took you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
she answered; &ldquo;very far away, I don&rsquo;t know how far,
in the jungles.&rdquo; &ldquo;How long ago was it?&rdquo; asked he.
&ldquo;At such and such a time,&rdquo; she replied. Then he
called credible and trustworthy witnesses, who proved
that Champa Ranee had never left the city at the time
she mentioned. After hearing whom, the Parrot said
to her, &ldquo;Is it possible that you can have the folly to
think any one would believe that you would leave your
rich and costly home to go a long journey into the
jungle? It is now satisfactorily proved that you did
not do it; you had better give up all claim to the
thousand gold mohurs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this the Nautch girl would not do. The Parrot
then called for a money-lender, and begged of him
the loan of a thousand gold mohurs, which he placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
in a great bottle, putting the stopper in, and sealing it
securely down; he then gave it to the Nautch girl, and
said, &ldquo;Get this money if you can, without breaking the
seal or breaking the bottle.&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;It cannot
be done.&rdquo; &ldquo;No more,&rdquo; replied Vicram Maharajah,
&ldquo;can what you desire be done. You cannot force
a poor man, who has no money in the world, to pay
you a thousand gold mohurs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the prisoner go free! Begone, Champa Ranee.
Dancing girl! you are a liar and a thief; go rob the
rich if you will, but meddle no more with the poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All applauded Vicram Maharajah Parrot&rsquo;s decision,
and said, &ldquo;Was ever such a wonderful bird!&rdquo; But
Champa Ranee was extremely angry, and said to him,
&ldquo;Very well, nasty polly; nasty, stupid polly! be assured
before long I will get you in my power, and
when I do, I will bite off your head!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try your worst, madam,&rdquo; answered Vicram; &ldquo;but
in return, I tell you this&mdash;I will live to make you a
beggar. Your house shall be, by your own order, laid
even with the ground, and you for grief and rage shall
kill yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Champa Ranee; &ldquo;we will soon see
whose words come true&mdash;mine or yours;&rdquo; and so saying,
she returned home.</p>

<p>The merchant took Vicram Maharajah back to his
shop, and a week passed without adventure; a fortnight
passed, but still nothing particular happened.
At the end of this time the merchant&rsquo;s eldest son was
married, and in honor of the occasion, the merchant
ordered that a clever dancing-girl should be sent for, to
dance before the guests. Champa Ranee came, and
danced so beautifully that every one was delighted;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
and the merchant was much pleased, and said to her,
&ldquo;You have done your work very well, and in payment
you may choose what you like out of my shop or
house, and it shall be yours&mdash;whether jewels or rich
cloth, or whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She replied, &ldquo;I desire nothing of the kind: of jewels
and rich stuffs I have more than enough, but you shall
give me your pretty little parrot; I like it much, and
that is the only payment I will take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The merchant felt very much vexed, for he had
never thought the Nautch girl would ask for the parrot
which he was so fond of, and which had been so profitable
to him; he felt he would rather have parted with
anything he possessed than that; nevertheless, having
promised, he was bound to keep his word, so, with
many tears, he went to fetch his favorite. But Polly
cried, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be vexed, master; give me to the girl; I
can take good care of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Champa Ranee took Vicram Maharajah Parrot
home with her; and no sooner did she get there than
she sent for one of her maids, and said, &ldquo;Quick, take
this parrot and boil him for my supper; but first cut
off his head and bring it to me on a plate, grilled; for
I will eat it before tasting any other dish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What nonsensical idea is this of our mistress,&rdquo; said
the maid to another, as she took the parrot into the
kitchen; &ldquo;to think of eating a grilled parrot&rsquo;s head!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better prepare
it as she bids you, or she&rsquo;ll be very cross.&rdquo; Then the
maid who had received the order began plucking the
long feathers out of Vicram Maharajah&rsquo;s wings, he all
the time hanging down his head, so that she thought he
was dead. Then, going to fetch some water in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
to boil him, she laid him down close to the place where
they washed the dishes. Now, the kitchen was on the
ground floor, and there was a hole right through the
wall, into which the water used in washing the dishes
ran, and through which all the scraps, bones, peelings
and parings were washed away after the daily cooking;
and in this hole Vicram Maharajah hid himself, quick
as thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! oh dear!&rdquo; cried the maid when she returned.
&ldquo;What can I do? what will my mistress say?
I only turned my back for one moment, and the parrot&rsquo;s
gone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; answered the other maid,
&ldquo;some cat has taken it away. It could not have been
alive, and flown or run away, or I should have seen
it go; but never fear, a chicken will do very well for
her instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they took a chicken and boiled it, and grilled
the head and took it to their mistress; and she ate it,
little bit by little bit, saying as she did so&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, pretty polly! so here&rsquo;s the end of you! This
is the brain that thought so cunningly and devised my
overthrow! this is the tongue that spoke against me!
this is the throat through which came the threatening
words! Aha! who is right now, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vicram, in the hole close by, heard her and felt very
much alarmed; for he thought, &ldquo;If she should catch
me after all!&rdquo; He could not fly away, for all his wing
feathers had been pulled out; so there he had to stay
some time, living on the scraps that were washed into
the hole in the washing of the plates, and perpetually
exposed to danger of being drowned in the streams of
water that were poured through it. At last, however,
his new feathers were sufficiently grown to bear him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
and he flew away to a little temple in the jungle some
way off, where he perched behind the idol.</p>

<p>It happened that Champa Ranee used to go to that
temple, and he had not been there long before she came
there to worship her idol.</p>

<p>She fell on her knees before the image, and began to
pray. Her prayer was that the god would transport
her body and soul to heaven (for she had a horror of
dying), and she cried, &ldquo;Only grant my prayer&mdash;only
let this be so, and I will do anything you wish&mdash;anything&mdash;anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vicram Maharajah was hidden behind the image and
heard her, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Champa Ranee Nautch girl, your prayer is heard!&rdquo;
(She thought the idol himself was speaking to her, and
listened attentively.) &ldquo;This is what you must do: sell
all you possess, and give the money to the poor; you
must also give money to all your servants and dismiss
them. Level also your house to the ground, that you
may be wholly separated from earth. Then you will
be fit for heaven. Come, having done all I command
you, on this day week to this place, and you shall be
transported thither body and soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Champa Ranee believed what she heard, and forgetful
of Vicram Maharajah Parrot&rsquo;s threat, hastened
to do as she was bidden. She sold her possessions,
and gave all the money to the poor; razed her house
to the ground, and dismissed her servants; which being
accomplished, on the day appointed she went to the
temple, and sat on the edge of a well outside it, explaining
to the assembled people how the idol himself
had spoken to her, and how they would shortly see her
caught up to heaven, and thus her departure from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
world would be even more celebrated than her doings
whilst in it. All the people listened eagerly to her
words, for they believed her inspired, and to see her
ascension the whole city had come out, with hundreds
and hundreds of strangers and travelers, princes, merchants
and nobles, from far and near, all full of expectation
and curiosity.</p>

<p>Then, as they waited, a fluttering of little wings was
heard, and a parrot flew over Champa Ranee&rsquo;s head,
calling out, &ldquo;Nautch girl! Nautch girl! what have
you done?&rdquo; Champa Ranee recognized the voice as
Vicram&rsquo;s; he went on: &ldquo;Will you go body and soul
to heaven? have you forgotten polly&rsquo;s words?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Champa Ranee rushed into the temple, and, falling
on her knees before the idol, cried out, &ldquo;Gracious
Power, I have done all as you commanded; let your
words come true; save me; take me to heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Parrot above her cried, &ldquo;Good-bye, Champa
Ranee, good-bye; you ate a chicken&rsquo;s head, not mine.
Where is your house now? where your servants and
all your possessions? Have my words come true,
think you, or yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the woman saw all, and in her rage and despair,
cursing her own folly, she fell violently down on
the floor of the temple, and dashing her head against
the stone, killed herself.</p>

<p>It was now two years since the Rajah Vicram left
his kingdom; and about six months before, Butti, in
despair of his ever returning, had set out to seek for
him. Up and down through many countries had he
gone, searching for his master, but without success.
As good fortune would have it, however, he chanced
to be one of those strangers who had come to witness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
the Nautch girl&rsquo;s translation, and no sooner did he see
the Parrot which spoke to her than in him he recognized
Vicram. The Rajah also saw him, and flew on
to his shoulder, upon which Butti caught him, put him
in a cage and took him home.</p>

<p>Now was a puzzling problem to be solved. The
Rajah&rsquo;s soul was in the Parrot&rsquo;s body, and the Carpenter&rsquo;s
son&rsquo;s soul in the Rajah&rsquo;s body. How was the
latter to be expelled to make way for the former?
He could not return to his own body, for that had
perished long before. The Wuzeer knew not how to
manage the matter, and determined therefore to await
the course of events.</p>

<p>It happened that the pretended Rajah and Butti each
had a fighting ram, and one day the Rajah said to the
Wuzeer, &ldquo;Let us set our rams to fight to-day, and try
the strength of mine against yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; answered
the Wuzeer; and they set them to fight. But
there was much difference in the two rams; for when
Butti&rsquo;s ram was but a lamb, and his horns were growing,
Butti had tied him to a lime tree, and his horns
had got very strong indeed by constantly rubbing
against its tender stem and butting against it; but the
Carpenter&rsquo;s son had tied his ram, when a lamb, to a
young teak tree, the trunk of which was so stout and
strong that the little creature, butting against it, could
make no impression on it, but only damaged and
loosened his own horns.</p>

<p>The pretended Rajah soon saw, to his vexation, that
his favorite&rsquo;s horns being less strong than its opponent&rsquo;s,
he was getting tired, and beginning to lose
courage, would certainly be worsted in the fight; so,
quick as thought, he left his own body and transported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
his soul into the ram&rsquo;s body, in order to give it an
increase of courage and resolution, and enable it to
win.</p>

<p>No sooner did Vicram Maharajah, who was hanging
up in a cage, see what had taken place, than he left the
parrot&rsquo;s body and re-entered his own body. Then
Butti&rsquo;s ram pushed the other down on its knees and
the Wuzeer ran and fetched a sword, and cut off its
head; thus putting an end, with the life of the ram, to
the life of the Carpenter&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>Great was the joy of Anar Ranee and all the household
at recovering the Rajah after his long absence;
and Anar Ranee prayed him to fly away no more as a
parrot, which he promised her he would not do.</p>

<p>But the taste for wandering and love of an unsettled
life did not leave him on his resuming his proper form;
and one of the things in which he most delighted was
to roam about the jungles near the palace by himself,
without attendant or guide. One very sultry day,
when he was thus out by himself, he wandered over a
rocky part of the country, which was flat and arid,
without a tree upon it to offer shelter from the burning
sun. Vicram, tired with his walk, threw himself down
by the largest piece of rock he could find to rest. As
he lay there, half asleep, a little Cobra came out of a
hole in the ground, and seeing his mouth wide open
(which looked like some shady cranny in a rock), crept
in and curled himself up in the Rajah&rsquo;s throat.</p>

<p>Vicram Maharajah called out to the Cobra, &ldquo;Get
out of my throat.&rdquo; But the Cobra said, &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t
go; I like being here better then under ground;&rdquo; and
there he stayed. Vicram didn&rsquo;t know what to do, for
the Cobra lived in his throat and could not be got out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
At times it would peep out of his mouth, but the moment
the Rajah tried to catch it, it ran back again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who ever heard of a Rajah in such a miserable
plight?&rdquo; sighed he to Butti&mdash;&ldquo;to think of having this
Cobra in my throat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear friend,&rdquo; Butti would answer, &ldquo;why
will you go roaming about the country by yourself?
Will you never be cured of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If one could only catch this Cobra, I&rsquo;d be content
to wander no more,&rdquo; said the Rajah, &ldquo;for my wandering
has not brought me much good of late.&rdquo; But to
catch the Cobra was more than any man could do. At
last, one day, Vicram, driven nearly mad in this perplexity,
ran away into the jungle. Tidings of this were
soon brought to Butti, who was much grieved to hear
it, and sighed, saying, &ldquo;Alas! alas! of what avail to
Vicram Maharajah is his more than human wisdom,
when the one unlucky self-chosen gift neutralizes all the
good he might do with it! It has given him a love of
wandering hither and thither, minding everybody&rsquo;s
business but his own; his kingdom is neglected, his
people uncared for, and he, that used to be the pride of
all Rajahs, the best, the noblest, has finally slunk out
of his country, like a thief escaping from jail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Butti sent messengers far and wide seeking Vicram
Maharajah, but they could not find him; he then determined
to go himself in search of his lost friend; and
having made proper arrangements for the government
of the country during his absence, he set off on his travels.</p>

<p>Meantime Vicram wandered on and on until at last,
one day, he came to the palace of a certain Rajah, who
reigned over a country very far from his own, and he
sat down with the beggars at the palace gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
Now, the Rajah at whose gate Vicram Maharajah
sat had a good and lovely daughter, named Buccoulee.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Many Princes wished to marry this Princess, but she
would marry none of them. Her father and mother
said to her, &ldquo;Why will you not choose a husband?
Among all these Princes who ask you in marriage
there are many rich and powerful&mdash;many handsome
and brave&mdash;many wise and good; why will you refuse
them all?&rdquo; The Princess replied, &ldquo;It is not my destiny
to marry any of them; continually in my dreams I see
my destined husband, and I wait for him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is
he?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;His name,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;is the
Rajah Vicram; he will come from a very far country;
he has not come yet.&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;There is no
Rajah, far or near, that we know of, of this name;
give over this fancy of yours and marry some one
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she constantly refused, saying, &ldquo;No, I will wait
for the Rajah Vicram.&rdquo; Her parents thought, &ldquo;It may
be even as she says. Who knows but perhaps some
day a great King, greater than any we know, may come
to this country and wish to marry the girl; we shall
then be glad that we had not obliged her to marry any
of her present suitors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner had Vicram Maharajah come to the
palace gate, and sat down there with the beggars, than
the Princess Buccoulee, looking out of the window,
saw him and cried, &ldquo;There is the husband I saw in my
dreams; there is the Rajah Vicram.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where, child,
where?&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no Rajah there;
only a parcel of beggars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Princess persisted that one of them was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
Rajah Vicram. Then the Ranee sent for Vicram Maharajah
and questioned him.</p>

<p>He said his name was &ldquo;Rajah Vicram.&rdquo; But the
Rajah and Ranee did not believe him; and they were
very angry with the Princess because she persisted in
saying that he, and no other, would she marry. At last
they got so enraged with her that they said, &ldquo;Well,
marry your beggar husband, if you will, but don&rsquo;t think
to remain any longer our daughter after becoming his
wife; if you marry him it shall be to follow his fortunes
in the jungle; we shall soon see you repent your obstinacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will marry him and follow him wherever he goes,&rdquo;
said the Princess.</p>

<p>So Vicram Maharajah and the Princess Buccoulee
were married, and her parents turned her out of the
house; nevertheless, they allowed her a little money.
&ldquo;For,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;she will fast enough find the difference
between a king&rsquo;s daughter and a beggar&rsquo;s wife,
without wanting food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vicram built a little hut in the jungle, and there they
lived; but the poor Princess had a sad time of it, for
she was neither accustomed to cook nor wash, and the
hard work tired her very much. Her chief grief, however,
was that Vicram should have such a hideous tormentor
as the Cobra in his throat; and often and often
of a night she sat awake, trying to devise some means
for catching it, but all in vain.</p>

<p>At last, one night, when she was thinking about it,
she saw close by two Cobras come out of their holes,
and as they began to talk, she listened to hear what
they would say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are these people?&rdquo; said the first Cobra.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
&ldquo;These,&rdquo; said the second, &ldquo;are the Rajah Vicram, and
his wife the Princess Buccoulee.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are they doing
here? why is the Rajah so far from his kingdom?&rdquo; asked
the first Cobra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he ran away because he was so miserable; he
has a Cobra that lives in his throat,&rdquo; answered the
second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can no one get it out?&rdquo; said the first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;because they do not
know the secret.&rdquo; &ldquo;What secret?&rdquo; asked the first
Cobra. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; said the second; &ldquo;why,
if his wife only took a few marking nuts,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and
pounded them well, and mixed them in cocoa-nut oil,
and set the whole on fire, and hung the Rajah, her
husband, head downward up in a tree above it, the
smoke, rising upward, would instantly kill the Cobra
in his mouth, which would tumble down dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of that before,&rdquo; said the first Cobra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; exclaimed the second. &ldquo;Why, if
they did the same thing at the mouth of your hole,
they&rsquo;d kill you in no time; and then, perhaps, they
might find all the fine treasure you have there!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke in that way,&rdquo; said the first Cobra; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like it;&rdquo; and he crawled away quite offended, and
the second Cobra followed him.</p>

<p>No sooner had the Princess heard this than she determined
to try the experiment. So next morning she
sent for all the villagers living near (who all knew and
loved her, and would do anything she told them, because
she was the Rajah&rsquo;s daughter), and bade them
take a great cauldron and fill it with cocoa-nut oil, and
pound down an immense number of marking nuts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
throw them into it, and then bring the cauldron to her.
They did so, and she set the whole on fire, and caused
Vicram to be hung up in a tree overhead; and as soon
as the smoke from the cauldron rose in the air it suffocated
the Cobra in Vicram Maharajah&rsquo;s throat, which
fell down quite dead. Then the Rajah Vicram said to
his wife, &ldquo;O worthy Buccoulee! what a noble woman
you are! You have delivered me from this torment,
which was more than all the wise men in my kingdom
could do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Buccoulee then caused the cauldron of oil to be
placed close to the hole of the first Cobra, which she
had heard speaking the night before, and he was suffocated.</p>

<p>She then ordered the people to dig him out of his
hole, and in it they found a vast amount of treasure&mdash;gold,
silver and jewels. Then Buccoulee sent for royal
robes for herself and her husband, and bade him cut
his hair and shave him; and when they were all ready,
she took the remainder of the treasure and returned
with it to her father&rsquo;s house; and her father and mother,
who had repented of their harshness, gladly welcomed
her back, and were both surprised and delighted to see
all the vast treasures she had, and what a handsome,
princely-looking man her husband was.</p>

<p>Then one day news was brought to Vicram that a
stranger Wuzeer had arrived in the palace as the
Rajah&rsquo;s guest, and that this Wuzeer had for twelve
years been wandering round the world in search of his
master, but, not having found him, was returning to his
own home. Vicram thought to himself, &ldquo;Can this
possibly be Butti?&rdquo; and he ran to see.</p>

<p>It was indeed Butti, who cried for joy to see him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
saying, &ldquo;Oh Vicram, Vicram! do you know it is
twelve years since you left us all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Vicram Maharajah told Butti how the good
Princess Buccoulee had married him and succeeded in
killing the Cobra, and how he was then on the point of
returning to his own country. So they all set out together,
being given many rich presents by Buccoulee&rsquo;s
father and mother. At last after a long, long journey,
they reached home. Anar Ranee was overjoyed to see
them again, for she had long mourned her husband as
dead. When Buccoulee Ranee was told who Anar
Ranee was and taken to see her, she felt very much frightened,
for she thought, &ldquo;Perhaps she will be jealous of
me and hate me.&rdquo; But with a gentle smile Anar Ranee
came to meet her, saying, &ldquo;Sister, I hear it is to you we
owe the preservation of the Rajah, and that it was you
who killed the Cobra; I can never be sufficiently
grateful to you, nor love you enough, as long as I
live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that day Vicram Maharajah stayed in his own
kingdom, ruling it wisely and well, and beloved by all.
He and Butti lived to a good old age, and their affection
for each other lasted as long as they lived. So
that it became a proverb in that country, and instead of
saying, &ldquo;So-and-so love each other like brothers&rdquo;
(when speaking of two who were much attached), the
people would say, &ldquo;So-and-so love each other like the
Rajah and the Wuzeer.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>VIII.<br />
<br />
<i>LESS INEQUALITY THAN MEN DEEM.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> YOUNG Rajah once said to his Wuzeer, &ldquo;How
is it that I am so often ill? I take care of myself;
I never go out in the rain; I wear warm clothes;
I eat good food. Yet I am always catching cold or
getting fever, in spite of all precautions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Overmuch care is worse than none at all,&rdquo; answered
the Wuzeer, &ldquo;which I will soon prove to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he invited the Rajah to accompany him for a
walk in the fields. Before they had gone very far they
met a poor Shepherd. The Shepherd was accustomed
to be out all day long, tending his flock; he had only a
coarse cloak on, which served but insufficiently to protect
him from the rain and the cold&mdash;from the dews by
night and the sun by day; his food was parched corn,
his drink water; and he lived out in the fields in a
small hut made of plaited palm branches. The Wuzeer
said to the Rajah, &ldquo;You know perfectly well
what hard lives these poor shepherds lead. Accost
this one, and ask him if he often suffers from the exposure
which he is obliged to undergo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah did as the Wuzeer told him, and asked
the Shepherd whether he did not often suffer from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
rheumatism, cold and fever. The Shepherd answered,
&ldquo;Perhaps it will surprise you, sire, to hear that I never
suffer from either the one or the other. From childhood
I have been accustomed to endure the extremes
of heat and cold, and I suppose that is why they never
affect me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the Rajah was very much astonished, and he
said to the Wuzeer, &ldquo;I own I am surprised; but
doubtless this Shepherd is an extraordinarily strong
man, whom nothing would ever affect.&rdquo; &ldquo;We shall
see,&rdquo; said the Wuzeer; and he invited the Shepherd to
the palace. There, for a long time, the Shepherd was
taken great care of; he was never permitted to go out
in the sun or rain, he had good food and good clothes,
and he was not allowed to sit in a draught or get his
feet wet. At the end of some months the Wuzeer sent
for him into a marble courtyard, the floor of which he
caused to be sprinkled with water.</p>

<p>The Shepherd had been for some time so little used
to exposure of any kind that wetting his feet caused
him to take cold; the place felt to him chilly and damp
after the palace; he rapidly became worse, and in a
short time, in spite of all the doctors&rsquo; care, he died.
&ldquo;Where is our friend the Shepherd?&rdquo; asked the Rajah,
a few days afterward; &ldquo;he surely could not have
caught cold merely by treading on the marble floor you
had caused to be sprinkled with water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; answered the Wuzeer, &ldquo;the result was
more disastrous than I had anticipated; the poor Shepherd
caught cold and is dead. Having been lately
accustomed to overmuch care, the sudden change of
temperature killed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
&ldquo;You see now to what dangers we are exposed from
which the poor are exempt. It is thus that Nature
equalizes her best gifts; wealth and opulence tend too
frequently to destroy health and shorten life, though
they may give much enjoyment to it whilst it lasts.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>IX.<br />
<br />
<i>PANCH-PHUL RANEE.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> CERTAIN Rajah had two wives, of whom he
preferred the second to the first; the first Ranee
had a son, but, because he was not the child of the
second Ranee, his father took a great dislike to him,
and treated him so harshly that the poor boy was very
unhappy.</p>

<p>One day, therefore, he said to his mother: &ldquo;Mother,
my father does not care for me, and my presence is
only a vexation to him. I should be happier anywhere
than here; let me therefore go and seek my fortune in
other lands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Ranee asked her husband if he would allow
their son to travel. He said, &ldquo;The boy is free to go,
but I don&rsquo;t see how he is to live in any other part of
the world, for he is too stupid to earn his living, and I
will give him no money to squander on senseless pleasures.&rdquo;
Then the Ranee told her son that he had his
father&rsquo;s permission to travel, and said to him, &ldquo;You
are going out into the world now to try your luck; take
with you the food and clothes I have provided for your
journey.&rdquo; And she gave him a bundle of clothes and
several small loaves, and in each loaf she placed a
gold mohur, that on opening it, he might find money
as well as food inside; and he started on his journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
When the young Rajah had traveled a long way,
and left his father&rsquo;s kingdom far behind, he one day
came upon the outskirts of a great city, where (instead
of taking the position due to his rank, and sending to
inform the Rajah of his arrival) he went to a poor
Carpenter&rsquo;s house, and begged of him a lodging for the
night. The Carpenter was busy making wooden clogs
in the porch of his house, but he looked up and nodded,
saying, &ldquo;Young man, you are welcome to any assistance
a stranger may need and we can give. If you are
in want of food, you will find my wife and daughter in
the house: they will be happy to cook for you.&rdquo; The
Rajah went inside and said to the Carpenter&rsquo;s daughter,
&ldquo;I am a stranger, and have traveled a long way; I am
both tired and hungry: cook me some dinner as fast as
you can, and I will pay you for your trouble.&rdquo; She
answered, &ldquo;I would willingly cook you some dinner at
once, but I have no wood to light the fire, and the
jungle is some way off.&rdquo; &ldquo;It matters not,&rdquo; said the
Rajah; &ldquo;this will do to light the fire, and I&rsquo;ll make
the loss good to your father;&rdquo; and taking a pair of new
clogs which the Carpenter had just finished making, he
broke them up and lighted the fire with them.</p>

<p>Next morning he went into the jungle, cut wood,
and, having made a pair of new clogs&mdash;better than
those with which he had lighted the fire the evening
before&mdash;placed them with the rest of the goods for sale
in the Carpenter&rsquo;s shop. Shortly afterward, one of the
servants of the Rajah of that country came to buy a
pair of clogs for his master, and seeing these new ones,
said to the Carpenter, &ldquo;Why, man, these clogs are
better than all the rest put together. I will take none
other to the Rajah. I wish you would always make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
such clogs as these.&rdquo; And throwing down ten gold
mohurs on the floor of the hut, he took up the clogs
and went away.</p>

<p>The Carpenter was much surprised at the whole
business. In the first place, he usually received only
two or three rupees for each pair of clogs; and in the
second, he knew that these which the Rajah&rsquo;s servant
had judged worth ten gold mohurs had not been made
by him; and how they had come there he could not
think, for he felt certain they were not with the rest of
the clogs the night before. He thought and thought,
but the more he thought about the matter the more puzzled
he got, and he went to talk about it to his wife and
daughter. Then his daughter said, &ldquo;Oh, those must
have been the clogs the stranger made!&rdquo; And she told
her father how he had lighted the fire the night before
with two of the clogs which were for sale, and had
afterward fetched wood from the jungle and made another
pair to replace them.</p>

<p>The Carpenter at this news was more astonished than
ever, and he thought to himself, &ldquo;Since this stranger
seems a quiet, peaceable sort of man, and can make
clogs so well, it is a great pity he should leave this
place: he would make a good husband for my daughter;&rdquo;
and, catching hold of the young Rajah, he propounded
his scheme to him. (But all this time he had
no idea that his guest was a Rajah.)</p>

<p>Now the Carpenter&rsquo;s daughter was a very pretty girl&mdash;as
pretty as any Ranee you ever saw; she was also
good-tempered, clever, and could cook extremely well.
So when the Carpenter asked the Rajah to be his son-in-law,
he looked at the father, the mother and the girl,
and thinking to himself that many a better man had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
worse fate, he said, &ldquo;Yes, I will marry your daughter,
and stay here and make clogs.&rdquo; So the Rajah married
the Carpenter&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>This Rajah was very clever at making all sorts of
things in wood. When he had made all the clogs he
wished to sell next day, he would amuse himself in
making toys; and in this way he made a thousand
wooden parrots. They were as like real parrots as
possible. They had each two wings, two legs, two
eyes and a sharp beak. And when the Rajah had
finished them all, he painted and varnished them and
put them one afternoon outside the house to dry.</p>

<p>Night came on, and with it came Parbuttee and
Mahdeo,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> flying round the world to see the different
races of men. Amongst the many places they visited
was the city where the Carpenter lived; and in the
garden in front of the house they saw the thousand
wooden parrots which the Rajah had made and painted
and varnished, all placed out to dry. Then Parbuttee
turned to Mahdeo, and said, &ldquo;These parrots are very
well made&mdash;they need nothing but life. Why should
not we give them life?&rdquo; Mahdeo answered, &ldquo;What
would be the use of that? It would be a strange freak,
indeed!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Parbuttee, &ldquo;I only meant you to
do it as an amusement. It would be so funny to see the
wooden parrots flying about! But do not do it if you
don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; &ldquo;You would like it then?&rdquo; answered
Mahdeo. &ldquo;Very well, I will do it.&rdquo; And he endowed
the thousand parrots with life.</p>

<p>Parbuttee and Mahdeo then flew away.</p>

<p>Next morning the Rajah got up early to see if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
varnish he had put on the wooden parrots was dry; but
no sooner did he open the door than&mdash;marvel of marvels!&mdash;the
thousand wooden parrots all came walking
into the house, flapping their wings and chattering to
each other.</p>

<p>Hearing the noise, the Carpenter and the Carpenter&rsquo;s
wife and daughter came running out to see what was
the matter, and were not less astonished than the Rajah
himself at the miracle which had taken place. Then
the Carpenter&rsquo;s wife turned to her son-in-law, and said,
&ldquo;It is all very well that you should have made these
wooden parrots; but I don&rsquo;t know where we are to find
food for them! Great, strong parrots like these will eat
not less than a pound of rice a-piece every day. Your
father-in-law and I cannot afford to procure as much as
that for them in this poor house. If you wish to keep
them, you must live elsewhere, for we cannot provide
for you all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Rajah; &ldquo;you shall not have
cause to accuse me of ruining you, for from henceforth
I will have a house of my own.&rdquo; So he and his wife
went to live in a house of their own, and he took the
thousand parrots with him, and his mother-in-law gave
her daughter some corn and rice and money to begin
housekeeping with. Moreover, he found that the parrots,
that instead of being an expense, were the means
of increasing his fortune; for they flew away every
morning early to get food, and spent the whole day out
in the fields; and every evening, when they returned
home, each parrot brought in his beak a stalk of corn
or rice, or whatever it had found good to eat. So that
their master was regularly supplied with more food
than enough; and what with selling what he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
require, and working at his trade, he soon became quite
a rich carpenter.</p>

<p>After he had been living in this way very happily
for some time, one night, when he fell asleep, the
Rajah dreamed a wonderful dream, and this was the
dream:</p>

<p>He thought that very, very far away beyond the Red
Sea was a beautiful kingdom surrounded by seven
other seas; and that it belonged to a Rajah and Ranee
who had one lovely daughter, named Panch-Phul Ranee
(the Five Flower Queen), after whom the whole kingdom
was called Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s country; and that
this Princess lived in the centre of her father&rsquo;s kingdom,
in a little house round which were seven wide ditches,
and seven great hedges made of spears; and that she
was called Panch-Phul Ranee because she was so light
and delicate that she weighed no more than five white
lotus flowers! Moreover, he dreamed that this Princess
had vowed to marry no one who could not cross
the seven seas, and jump the seven ditches, and seven
hedges made of spears.</p>

<p>After dreaming this the young Rajah awoke, and
feeling much puzzled, got up, and sitting with his head
in his hands, tried to think the matter over and discover
if he had ever heard anything like his dream before;
but he could make nothing of it.</p>

<p>Whilst he was thus thinking, his wife awoke and
asked him what was the matter. He told her, and she
said, &ldquo;That is a strange dream. If I were you, I&rsquo;d
ask the old parrot about it; he is a wise bird, and perhaps
he knows.&rdquo; This parrot of which she spoke was
the most wise of all the thousand wooden parrots. The
Rajah took his wife&rsquo;s advice, and when all the birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
came home that evening, he called the old parrot and
told him his dream, saying, &ldquo;Can this be true?&rdquo; To
which the parrot replied, &ldquo;It is all true. The Panch-Phul
Ranee&rsquo;s country lies beyond the Red Sea, and is
surrounded by seven seas, and she dwells in a house
built in the centre of her father&rsquo;s kingdom. Round her
house are seven ditches, and seven hedges made of
spears, and she has vowed not to marry any man who
cannot jump these seven ditches and seven hedges;
and because she is very beautiful many great and noble
men have tried to do this, but in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Rajah and Ranee, her father and mother, are
very fond of her and proud of her. Every day she goes
to the palace to see them, and they weigh her in a pair
of scales. They put her in one scale and five lotus flowers
in the other, and she&rsquo;s so delicate and fragile she weighs
no heavier than the five little flowers, so they call her the
Panch-Phul Ranee. Her father and mother are very
proud of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to go to that country and see the Panch-Phul
Ranee,&rdquo; said the Rajah; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know how
I could cross the seven seas.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will show you how
to manage that,&rdquo; replied the old parrot. &ldquo;I and another
parrot will fly close together, I crossing my left over his
right wing; so that we will move along as if we were one
bird (using only our outside wings to fly with), and on
the chair made of our interlaced wings you shall sit, and
we will carry you safely across the seven seas. On the
way we will every evening alight in some high tree and
rest, and every morning we can go on again.&rdquo; &ldquo;That
sounds a good plan; I have a great desire to try it,&rdquo; said
the Rajah. &ldquo;Wife, what should you think of my going
to the Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s country, and seeing if I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
jump the seven ditches, and seven hedges made of spears?
Will you let me try?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;If you like to go and marry
her, go; only take care that you do not kill yourself;
and mind you come back some day.&rdquo; And she prepared
food for him to take with him, and took off her gold and
silver bangles, which she placed in a bundle of warm
things, that he might be in need neither of money nor
clothes on the journey. He then charged the nine hundred
and ninety-eight parrots he left behind him to bring
her plenty of corn and rice daily (that she might never
need food while he was away), and took her to the house
of her father, in whose care she was to remain during
his absence; and he wished her good-bye, saying, &ldquo;Do
not fear but that I will come back to you, even if I do
win the Panch-Phul Ranee, for you will always be my
first wife, though you are the Carpenter&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old parrot and another parrot then spread their
wings, on which the Rajah seated himself as on a chair,
and rising up in the air, they flew away with him out
of sight.</p>

<p>Far, far, far they flew, as fast as parrots can fly, over
hills, over forests, over rivers, over valleys, on, on, on,
hour after hour, day after day, week after week, only
staying to rest every night when it got too dark to see
where they were going. At last they reached the seven
seas which surrounded the Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s country.
When once they began crossing the seas they could not
rest (for there was neither rock nor island on which to
alight), so they were obliged to fly straight across them,
night and day, until they gained the shore.</p>

<p>By reason of this the parrots were too exhausted on
their arrival to go as far as the city where the Rajah,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s father, lived, but they flew down to
rest on a beautiful banyan tree, which grew not far from
the sea, close to a small village. The Rajah determined
to go into the village and get food and shelter there.
He told the parrots to stay in the banyan tree till his
return; then, leaving his bundle of clothes and most of
his money in their charge, he set off on foot toward
the nearest house.</p>

<p>After a little while he reached a Malee&rsquo;s cottage, and
giving a gold mohur to the Malee&rsquo;s wife, got her to
provide him with food and shelter for the night.</p>

<p>Next morning he rose early, and said to his hostess,
&ldquo;I am a stranger here, and know nothing of the place.
What is the name of your country?&rdquo; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;is Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is the last news in your town?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Very bad news indeed,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You must
know our Rajah has one only daughter&mdash;a most beautiful
Princess&mdash;and her name is Panch-Phul Ranee, for
she is so light and delicate that she weighs no heavier
than five lotus flowers. After her this whole country is
called Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s country. She lives in a small
bungalow<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> in the centre of the city you see yonder;
but, unluckily for us, she has vowed to marry no man
who cannot jump on foot over the seven hedges made
of spears, and across the seven great ditches that surround
her house. This cannot be done, Babamah!<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
I don&rsquo;t know how many hundreds of thousands of
Rajahs have tried to do it and died in the attempt!
Yet the Princess will not break her vow. Daily, worse
and worse tidings come from the city of fresh people
having been killed in trying to jump the seven hedges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
and seven ditches, and I see no end to the misfortunes
that will arise from it. Not only are so many brave
men lost to the world, but, since the Princess will marry
no one who does not succeed in this, she stands a chance
of not marrying at all; and if that be so, when the
Rajah dies there will be no one to protect her and claim
the right to succeed to the throne. All the nobles will
probably fight for the Raj, and the whole kingdom be
turned topsy-turvy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mahi,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> said the Rajah, &ldquo;if that is all there is to
do, I will try and win your Princess, for I can jump
right well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baba,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> answered the Malee&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;do not think
of such a thing; are you mad? I tell you, hundreds
of thousands of men have said these words before, and
been killed for their rashness. What power do you
think you possess to succeed where all before you have
failed? Give up all thought of this, for it is utter
folly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not do it,&rdquo; answered the Rajah, &ldquo;before going
to consult some of my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he left the Malee&rsquo;s cottage, and returned to the
banyan tree to talk over the matter with the parrots;
for he thought they would be able to carry him on their
wings across the seven ditches and seven hedges made
of spears. When he reached the tree the old parrot
said to him, &ldquo;It is two days since you left us; what
news have you brought from the village?&rdquo; The Rajah
answered, &ldquo;The Panch-Phul Ranee still lives in the
house surrounded by the seven ditches, and seven hedges
made of spears, and has vowed to marry no man who
cannot jump over them; but cannot you parrots, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
brought me all the way over the seven seas, carry me
on your wings across these great barriers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stupid man!&rdquo; answered the old parrot; &ldquo;of
course we could; but what would be the good of doing
so? If we carried you across, it would not be at all
the same thing as your jumping across, and the Princess
would no more consent to marry you than she
would now; for she has vowed to marry no one who
has not jumped across <em>on foot</em>. If you want to do the
thing, why not do it yourself, instead of talking nonsense.
Have you forgotten how, when you were a little
boy, you were taught to jump by conjurors and
tumblers (for the parrot knew all the Rajah&rsquo;s history)?
Now is the time to put their lessons in practice. If
you can jump the seven ditches, and seven hedges
made of spears, you will have done a good work, and
be able to marry the Panch-Phul Ranee; but if not,
this is a thing in which we cannot help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You reason justly,&rdquo; replied the Rajah. &ldquo;I will
try to put in practice the lessons I learnt when a boy;
meantime, do you stay here till my return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he went away to the city, which he
reached by nightfall. Next morning early he went to
where the Princess&rsquo; bungalow stood, to try and jump
the fourteen great barriers. He was strong and agile,
and he jumped the seven great ditches, and six of the
seven hedges made of spears; but in running to jump
the seventh hedge he hurt his foot, and, stumbling, fell
upon the spears and died&mdash;run through and through
with the cruel iron spikes.</p>

<p>When Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s father and mother got up
that morning and looked out, as their custom was, toward
their daughter&rsquo;s bungalow, they saw something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
transfixed upon the seventh hedge of spears, but what it
was they could not make out, for it dazzled their eyes.
So the Rajah called his Wuzeer and said to him, &ldquo;For
some days I have seen no one attempt to jump the
seven hedges and seven ditches round Panch-Phul
Ranee&rsquo;s bungalow; but what is that which I now see
upon the seventh hedge of spears?&rdquo; The Wuzeer answered,
&ldquo;That is a Rajah&rsquo;s son, who has failed like all
who have gone before him.&rdquo; &ldquo;But how is it,&rdquo; asked
the Rajah, &ldquo;that he thus dazzles our eyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied the Wuzeer, &ldquo;because he is so beautiful.
Of all that have died for the sake of Panch-Phul
Ranee, this youth is, beyond doubt, the handsomest.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried the Rajah, &ldquo;how many and
how many brave men has my daughter killed? I will
have no more die for her. Let us send her and the
dead man together away into the jungle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he ordered the servants to fetch the young
Rajah&rsquo;s body. There he lay, still and beautiful, with
a glory shining round him as the moonlight shines
round the clear bright moon, but without a spark of life.</p>

<p>When the Rajah saw him, he said, &ldquo;Oh pity, pity,
that so brave and handsome a boy should have come
dying after this girl! Yet he is but one of the thousands
of thousands who have died thus to no purpose.
Pull up the spears and cast them into the seven ditches,
for they shall remain no longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he commanded two palanquins to be prepared
and men in readiness to carry them, and said, &ldquo;Let
the girl be married to the young Rajah, and let both be
taken far away into the jungle, that we may never see
them more. Then there will be quiet in the land
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
The Ranee, Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s mother, cried bitterly
at this, for she was very fond of her daughter, and
she begged her husband not to send her away so
cruelly&mdash;the living with the dead; but the Rajah was
inexorable. &ldquo;That poor boy died,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;let my
daughter die too. I&rsquo;ll have no more men killed here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the two palanquins were prepared. Then he
placed his daughter in the one, and her dead husband
in the other, and said to the palkee-bearers, &ldquo;Take
these palkees and go out into the jungle until you have
reached a place so desolate that not so much as a sparrow
is to be seen, and there leave them both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so they did. Deep down in the jungle, where
no bright sun could pierce the darkness, nor human
voice be heard, far from any habitation of man or
means of supporting life, on the edge of a dank, stagnant
morass that was shunned by all but noisome reptiles
and wandering beasts of prey, they set them down
and left them, the dead husband and the living wife,
alone to meet the horrors of the coming night&mdash;alone,
without a chance of rescue.</p>

<p>Panch-Phul Ranee heard the bearers&rsquo; retreating footsteps,
and their voices getting fainter and fainter in the
distance, and felt that she had nothing to hope for
but death.</p>

<p>Night seemed coming on apace, for though the sun
had not set, the jungle was so dark that but little light
pierced the gloom; and she thought she would take a
last look at the husband her vow had killed, and sitting
beside him wait till starvation should make her as he
was, or some wild animal put a more speedy end to
her sufferings.</p>

<p>She left her palkee and went toward his. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
he lay with closed eyes and close-shut lips: black curling
hair, which escaped from under his turban, concealed
a ghastly wound on his temple. There was no
look of pain on the face, and the long, sweeping eyelashes
gave it such a tender, softened expression she
could hardly believe that he was dead. He was, in
truth, very beautiful; and watching him she said to
herself, &ldquo;Alas, what a noble being is here lost to the
world! what an earth&rsquo;s joy is extinguished! Was it
for this that I was cold, and proud, and stern&mdash;to break
the cup of my own happiness and to be the death of
such as you? Must you now never know that you won
your wife? Must you never hear her ask your pardon
for the past, nor know her cruel punishment? Ah, if
you had but lived, how dearly I would have loved you!
Oh my husband! my husband!&rdquo; And sinking down
on the ground, she buried her face in her hands and
cried bitterly.</p>

<p>While she was sitting thus night closed over the
jungle, and brought with it wild beasts that had left
their dens and lairs in search of prey&mdash;to roam about,
as the heat of the day was over. Tigers, lions, elephants
and bison, all came by turns crushing through
the underwood which surrounded the place where the
palkees were, but they did no harm to Panch-Phul
Ranee, for she was so fair that not even the cruel
beasts of the forest would injure her. At last, about
four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, all the wild animals had
gone, except two little jackals, who had been very busy
watching the rest and picking the bones left by the
tigers. Tired with running about, they lay down to
rest close to the palkees. Then one little jackal said
to the other, who was her husband, &ldquo;Do tell me a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
little story.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what people
you women are for stories! Well, look just in front
of you; do you see those two?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered;
&ldquo;what of them?&rdquo; &ldquo;That woman you see sitting on
the ground,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the Panch-Phul Ranee.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And what son of a Rajah is the man in the palkee?&rdquo;
asked she. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;is a very sorrowful
son. His father was so unkind to him that he left his
own home, and went to live in another country very far
from this; and there he dreamed about the Panch-Phul
Ranee, and came to our land in order to marry her,
but he was killed in jumping the seventh hedge of
spears, and all he gained was to die for her sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very sad,&rdquo; said the first little jackal; &ldquo;but
could he never by any chance come to life again?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the other; &ldquo;may be he could, if only
some one knew how to apply the proper remedies.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What are the proper remedies, and how could he be
cured?&rdquo; asked the lady jackal. (Now all this conversation
had been heard by Panch-Phul Ranee, and when
this question was asked she listened very eagerly and
attentively for the answer.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see this tree?&rdquo; replied her husband. &ldquo;Well,
if some of its leaves were crushed, and a little of the
juice put into the Rajah&rsquo;s two ears and upon his upper
lip, and some upon his temples also, and some upon
the spear-wounds in his side, he would come to life
again and be as well as ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment day dawned, and the two little
jackals ran away. Panch-Phul Ranee did not forget
their words. She, a Princess born, who had never put
her foot to the ground before (so delicately and tenderly
had she been reared), walked over the rough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
clods of earth and the sharp stones till she reached the
place where the tree grew of which the jackals had
spoken. She gathered a number of its leaves, and,
with hands and feet that had never before done coarse
or common work, beat and crushed them down. They
were so stiff and strong that it took her a long time.
At last, after tearing them, and stamping on them, and
pounding them between two stones, and biting the
hardest parts, she thought they were sufficiently
crushed; and rolling them up in a corner of her saree,
she squeezed the juice through it on to her husband&rsquo;s
temples, and put a little on his upper lip and into his
ears, and some also on the spear-wound in his side.
And when she had done this, he awoke as if he had
been only sleeping, and sat up, wondering where he
was. Before him stood Panch-Phul Ranee shining
like a glorious star, and all around them was the dark
jungle.</p>

<p>It would be hard to say which of them was the most
astonished&mdash;the Rajah or the Princess. She was surprised
that the remedy should have taken such speedy
effect, and could hardly believe her eyes when she saw
her husband get up. And if he looked beautiful when
dead, much more handsome did he seem to her now,
so full of life and animation and power&mdash;the picture of
health and strength. And he in his turn was lost in
amazement at the exquisite loveliness of the lady who
stood before him. He did not know who she could be,
for he had never seen her like except in a dream.
Could she be really the world-renowned Panch-Phul
Ranee, or was he dreaming still? He feared to move
lest he should break the spell. But as he sat there
wondering, she spoke, saying, &ldquo;You marvel at what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
has taken place. You do not know me&mdash;I am Panch-Phul
Ranee, your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he said, &ldquo;Ah, Princess, is it indeed you? You
have been very hard to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; she
answered; &ldquo;I caused your death, but I brought you to
life again. Let the past be forgotten; come home
with me, and my father and mother will welcome you
as a son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He replied, &ldquo;No, I must first return to my own
home a while. Do you rather return there now with
me, for it is a long time since I left it, and afterward
we will come again to your father&rsquo;s kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this Panch-Phul Ranee agreed. It took them,
however, a long time to find their way out of the
jungle. At last they succeeded in doing so, for none
of the wild animals in it attempted to injure them, so
beautiful and royal did they both look.</p>

<p>When they reached the banyan tree, where the
Rajah had left the two parrots, the old parrot called
out to him, &ldquo;So you have come back at last! We
thought you never would, you were such a long time
away! There you went, leaving us here all the time,
and after all doing no good, but only getting yourself
killed. Why didn&rsquo;t you do as we advised you, and
jump up nicely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said the Rajah, &ldquo;yours is a hard
case; but I beg your pardon for keeping you waiting
so long, and now I hope you&rsquo;ll take me and my wife
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we will do that,&rdquo; answered the parrots; &ldquo;but
you had better get some dinner first, for it&rsquo;s a long
journey over the seven seas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Rajah went to the village close by and bought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
food for himself and the Panch-Phul Ranee. When
he returned with it, he said to her, &ldquo;I fear the long
journey before us for you: had you not better let me
make it alone, and return here for you when it is over?&rdquo;
But she answered, &ldquo;No! what could I, a poor, weak
woman, do here alone? and I will not return to my
father&rsquo;s house till you can come too. Take me with
you, however far you go; only promise me you will
never leave me.&rdquo; So he promised her, and they both,
mounting the parrots, were carried up in the air across
the seven seas, across the Red Sea, on, on, on, a whole
year&rsquo;s journey, until they reached his father&rsquo;s kingdom,
and alighted to rest at the foot of the palace garden.
The Rajah, however, did not know where he was, for
all had much changed since he left it some years
before.</p>

<p>Then a little son was born to the Rajah and Panch-Phul
Ranee. He was a beautiful child, but his father
was grieved to think that in that bleak place there was
no shelter for the mother or the baby. So he said to
his wife, &ldquo;I will go to fetch food for us both, and fire
to cook it with, and inquire what this country is, and
seek out a place of rest for you. Do not be afraid; I
shall soon return.&rdquo; Now, far off in the distance smoke
was to be seen rising from tents which belonged to
some conjurors and dancing-people, and thither the
Rajah bent his steps, feeling certain he should be able
to get fire, and perhaps food also, from the inhabitants.
When he got there, he found the place was much
larger than he had expected&mdash;quite a good-sized village
in fact&mdash;the abode of Nautch-people and conjurors.
In all the houses the people were busy, some dancing,
some singing, others trying various conjuring tricks or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
practising beating the drum, and all seemed happy and
joyful.</p>

<p>When the conjurors saw him, they were so much
struck with his appearance (for he was very handsome)
that they determined to make him, if possible, stay
among them and join their band. And they said one
to another, &ldquo;How well he would look beating the
drum for the dancers! All the world would come to
see us dance, if we had such a handsome man as that
to beat the drum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah, unconscious of their intentions, went into
the largest hut he saw, and said to a woman who was
grinding corn, &ldquo;Bai,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> give me a little rice, and some
fire from your hearth.&rdquo; She immediately consented,
and got up to fetch the burning sticks he asked for;
but before she gave them to him, she and her companions
threw upon them a certain powder, containing
a very potent charm; and no sooner did the Rajah receive
them than he forgot about his wife and little child,
his journey, and all that had ever happened to him in
his life before; such was the peculiar property of the
powder. And when the conjurors said to him, &ldquo;Why
should you go away? stay with us, and be one of us,&rdquo;
he willingly consented to do so.</p>

<p>All this time Panch-Phul Ranee waited and waited
for her husband, but he never came. Night approached
without his having brought her any food or news of
having found a place of shelter for her and the baby.
At last, faint and weary, she swooned away.</p>

<p>It happened that that very day the Ranee (Panch-Phul
Ranee&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s mother) lost her youngest child,
a fine little boy of only a day old; and her servants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
took its body to the bottom of the garden to bury it.
Just as they were going to do so, they heard a low cry,
and, looking round, saw close by a beautiful woman
lying on the ground, dead, or apparently so, and beside
her a fine little baby boy. The idea immediately
entered their heads of leaving the dead baby beside the
dead woman, and taking her living baby back with
them to the palace; and so they did.</p>

<p>When they returned, they said to their mistress, &ldquo;Your
child did not die; see here it is&mdash;it got well again,&rdquo; and
showed her Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s baby; but after a time,
when the Ranee questioned them about it, they told her
the whole truth, but she had become meanwhile very
fond of the little boy, and so he continued in the palace
and was brought up as her son; being, in truth, her
grandson, though she did not know it.</p>

<p>Meantime the palace Malee&rsquo;s wife went out, as her
custom was every morning, and evening, to gather
flowers. In search of them she wandered as far as the
jungle at the bottom of the garden, and there she found
the Panch-Phul Ranee lying as dead, and the dead
baby beside her.</p>

<p>The good woman felt very sorry, and rubbed the
Ranee&rsquo;s cold hands and gave her sweet flowers to smell,
in hopes that she might revive. At last she opened her
eyes, and seeing the Malee&rsquo;s wife, said, &ldquo;Where am I?
has not my husband come back? and who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor lady,&rdquo; answered the Malee&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;I do
not know where your husband is. I am the Malee&rsquo;s
wife, and coming here to gather flowers, I found you
lying on the ground, and this your little baby, which is
dead; but come home with me, I will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Panch-Phul Ranee answered, &ldquo;Kind friend, this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
not my baby; he did not die; he was the image of his
father, and fairer than this child. Some one must have
taken him away, for but a little while ago I held him
in my arms, and he was strong and well, while this
one could never have been more than a puny, weakly
infant. Take me away; I will go home with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Malee&rsquo;s wife buried the dead child and took
the Panch-Phul Ranee to her house, where she lived
for fourteen years; but all that time she could learn no
tidings of her husband or her lost little boy. The child,
meanwhile, grew up in the palace, and became a very
handsome youth. One day he was wandering round
the garden and chanced to pass the Malee&rsquo;s house.
The Panch-Phul Ranee was sitting within, watching
the Malee&rsquo;s wife cook their dinner.</p>

<p>The young Prince saw her, and calling the Malee&rsquo;s
wife, said to her, &ldquo;What beautiful lady is that in your
house? and how did she come there?&rdquo; She answered,
&ldquo;Little Prince, what nonsense you talk! there is no
lady here.&rdquo; He said again, &ldquo;I know there is a beautiful
lady here, for I saw her as I passed the open door.&rdquo;
She replied, &ldquo;If you come telling such tales about my
house, I&rsquo;ll pull your tongue out.&rdquo; For she thought to
herself, &ldquo;Unless I scold him well, the boy&rsquo;ll go talking
about what he&rsquo;s seen in the palace, and then perhaps
some of the people from there will come and take the
poor Panch-Phul Ranee away from my care.&rdquo; But
whilst the Malee&rsquo;s wife was talking to the young Prince,
the Panch-Phul Ranee came from the inner room to
watch and listen to him unobserved; and no sooner did
she see him than she could not forbear crying out, &ldquo;Oh,
how like he is to my husband! The same eyes, the
same shaped face and the same king-like bearing! Can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
he be my son? He is just the age my son would have
been had he lived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young Prince heard her speaking and asked
what she said, to which the Malee&rsquo;s wife replied, &ldquo;The
woman you saw, and who just now spoke, lost her
child fourteen years ago, and she was saying to herself
how like you were to that child, and thinking you must
be the same; but she is wrong, for we know you are the
Ranee&rsquo;s son.&rdquo; Then Panch-Phul Ranee herself came
out of the house, and said to him, &ldquo;Young Prince, I
could not, when I saw you, help exclaiming how like
you are to what my lost husband was, and to what my
son might have been; for it is now fourteen years since
I lost them both.&rdquo; And she told him how she had been
a great Princess, and was returning with her husband
to his own home (to which they had got halfway in
reaching that place), and how her little baby had been
born in the jungle, and her husband had gone away to
seek shelter for her and the child, and fire and food,
and had never returned; and also how, when she had
fainted away, some one had certainly stolen her baby
and left a dead child in its place; and how the good
Malee&rsquo;s wife had befriended her, and taken her ever
since to live in her house. And when she had ended
her story she began to cry.</p>

<p>But the Prince said to her, &ldquo;Be of good cheer; I will
endeavor to recover your husband and child for you:
who knows but I may indeed be your son, beautiful
lady?&rdquo; And running home to the Ranee (his adopted
mother), he said to her, &ldquo;Are you really my mother?
Tell me truly; for this I must know before the sun goes
down.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why do you ask foolish questions?&rdquo; she
replied; &ldquo;have I not always treated you as a son?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but tell me the very truth, am I your
own child, or the child of some one else, adopted as
yours? If you do not tell me, I will kill myself.&rdquo; And
so saying, he drew his sword. She replied, &ldquo;Stay, stay,
and I will tell you the whole truth: the day before you
were born I had a little baby, but it died; and my servants
took it to the bottom of the garden to bury it, and
there they found a beautiful woman lying as dead, and
beside her a living infant. You were that child. They
brought you to the palace, and I adopted you as my son,
and left my baby in your stead.&rdquo; &ldquo;What became of
my mother?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; answered the
Ranee; &ldquo;for, two days afterward, when I sent to the
same place, she and the baby had both disappeared, and
I have never since heard of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young Prince, on hearing this, said, &ldquo;There is
in the head Malee&rsquo;s house a beautiful lady, whom the
Malee&rsquo;s wife found in the jungle, fourteen years ago;
that must be my mother. Let her be received here this
very day with all honor, for that is the only reparation
that can now be made to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ranee consented, and the young Prince went
down to the Malee&rsquo;s house himself to fetch his mother
to the palace.</p>

<p>With him he took a great retinue of people, and a
beautiful palanquin for her to go in, covered with rich
trappings; also costly things for her to wear, and many
jewels and presents for the good Malee&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>When Panch-Phul Ranee had put on her son&rsquo;s gifts,
and come out of the Malee&rsquo;s poor cottage to meet him,
all the people said there had never been so royal-looking
a queen. As gold and clear crystal are lovely, as
mother-of-pearl is exquisitely fair and delicate-looking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
so beautiful, so fair, so delicate appeared Panch-Phul
Ranee.</p>

<p>Her son conducted her with much pomp and state to
the palace, and did all in his power to honor her; and
there she lived long very happily, and beloved by all.</p>

<p>One day the young Prince begged her to tell him
again, from the beginning, the story of her life, and as
much as she knew of his father&rsquo;s life; and so she did.
And after that, he said to her, &ldquo;Be no longer sad, dear
mother, regarding my father&rsquo;s fate; for I will send into
all lands to gather tidings of him, and maybe in the
end we shall find him.&rdquo; And he sent people out to
hunt for the Rajah all over the kingdom, and in all
neighboring countries&mdash;to the north, to the south, to the
east and to the west&mdash;but they found him not.</p>

<p>At last (after four years of unsuccessful search), when
there seemed no hope of ever learning what had become
of him, Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s son came to see her, and
said, &ldquo;Mother, I have sent into all lands seeking my
father, but can hear no news of him. If there were
only the slightest clue as to the direction in which he
went, there would still be some chance of tracing him,
but that, I fear, cannot be got. Do you not remember
his having said anything of the way which he intended
to go when he left you?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;When your
father went away, his words to me were, &lsquo;I will go to
fetch food for us both, and fire to cook it with, and
inquire what this country is, and seek out a place of
shelter for you. Do not be afraid&mdash;I shall soon return.&rsquo;
That was all he said, and then he went away, and I
never saw him more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what direction did he go from the foot of the
garden?&rdquo; asked the Prince. &ldquo;He went,&rdquo; answered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
Panch-Phul Ranee, &ldquo;toward that village of conjurors
close by. I thought he was intending to ask some of
them to give us food. But had he done so, he would
certainly have returned in a very short time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you should know my father, mother
darling, if you were to see him again?&rdquo; asked the
Prince. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;I should know him
again.&rdquo; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;even though eighteen
years have gone by since you saw him last? Even
though age and sickness and want had done their
utmost to change him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;his
every feature is so impressed on my heart that I should
know him again anywhere or in any disguise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let us,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;send for all those people
in the direction of whose houses he went away. Maybe
they have detained him among them to this day. It is
but a chance, but we can hope for nothing more certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Panch-Phul Ranee and her son sent down
orders to the conjurors&rsquo; village that every one of the
whole band should come up to the palace that afternoon&mdash;not
a soul was to stay behind. And the dancers
were to dance and the conjurors to play all their tricks
for the amusement of the palace inmates.</p>

<p>The people came. The nautch girls began to dance&mdash;running,
jumping and flying here, there and everywhere,
some up, some down, some round and round. The conjurors
conjured and all began in different ways to amuse
the company. Among the rest was one wild, ragged-looking
man, whose business was to beat the drum.
No sooner did the Panch-Phul Ranee set eyes on him
than she said to her son, &ldquo;Boy, that is your father!&rdquo;
&ldquo;What, mother!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that wretched-looking man
who is beating the drum?&rdquo; &ldquo;The same,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
The Prince said to his servants, &ldquo;Fetch that man
here.&rdquo; And the Rajah came toward them, so changed
that not even his own mother knew him&mdash;no one recognized
him but his wife. For eighteen years he had
been among the nautch people; his hair was rough, his
beard untrimmed, his face thin and worn, sunburnt and
wrinkled; he wore a nose-ring and heavy ear-rings,
such as the nautch people have; and his dress was a
rough, common cumlee.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> All traces of his former self
seemed to have disappeared. They asked him if he
did not remember he had been a Rajah once, and about
his journey to Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s country. But he
said, No, he remembered nothing but how to beat the
drum&mdash;Rub-a-dub! tat-tat! tom-tum! tom-tum! He
thought he must have beaten it all his life.</p>

<p>Then the young Prince gave orders that all the
nautch people should be put into jail until it could be
discovered what part they had taken in reducing his
father to so pitiable a state. And sending for the
wisest doctors in the kingdom, he said to them, &ldquo;Do
your best and restore the health of this Rajah, who has
to all appearance lost both memory and reason; and
discover, if possible, what has caused these misfortunes
to befall him.&rdquo; The doctors said, &ldquo;He has certainly
had some potent charm given to him, which has destroyed
both his memory and reason, but we will do
our best to counteract its influence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so they did. And their treatment succeeded so
well that, after a time, the Rajah entirely recovered his
former senses. And they took such good care of him
that in a little while he regained his health and strength
also, and looked almost as well as ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
He then found to his surprise that he, Panch-Phul
Ranee, and their son, had all this time been living in
his father&rsquo;s kingdom. His father was so delighted to
see him again that he was no longer unkind to him,
but treated him as a dearly beloved, long-lost son. His
mother also was overjoyed at his return, and they said
to him, &ldquo;Since you have been restored to us again,
why should you wander any more? Your wife and
son are here; do you also remain here, and live among
us for the rest of your days.&rdquo; But he replied, &ldquo;I have
another wife&mdash;the Carpenter&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;who first was
kind to me in my adopted country. I also have there
nine hundred and ninety-eight talking wooden parrots,
which I greatly prize. Let me first go and fetch
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They said, &ldquo;Very well; go quickly and then return.&rdquo;
So he mounted the two wooden parrots which
had brought him from the Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s country
(and which had for eighteen years lived in the jungle
close to the palace), and returned to the land where
his first wife lived, and fetched her and the nine hundred
and ninety-eight remaining wooden parrots to his
father&rsquo;s kingdom. Then his father said to him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
have any quarreling with your half-brother after I am
dead&rdquo; (for his half-brother was son of the old Rajah&rsquo;s
favorite wife). &ldquo;I love you both dearly, and will give
each of you half of my kingdom.&rdquo; So he divided the
kingdom into two halves, and gave the one half to the
Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s husband, who was the son of his
first wife, and the other half to the eldest son of his
second but favorite wife.</p>

<p>A short time after this arrangement was made,
Panch-Phul Ranee said to her husband, &ldquo;I wish to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
see my father and mother again before I die; let me go
and see them.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;You shall go, and I
and our son will also go.&rdquo; So he called four of the
wooden parrots&mdash;two to carry himself and the Ranee,
and two to carry their son. Each pair of parrots
crossed their wings; the young Prince sat upon the
two wings of one pair, and on the wings of the other
pair sat his father and mother. Then they all rose up
in the air, and the parrots carried them (as they had
before carried the Rajah alone), up, up, up, on, on,
on, over the Red Sea, and across the seven seas, until
they reached the Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s country.</p>

<p>Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s father saw them come flying
through the air as quickly as shooting stars, and much
wondering who they were, he sent out many of his nobles
and chief officers to inquire.</p>

<p>The nobles went out to meet them, and called out,
&ldquo;What great Rajah is this who is dressed so royally,
and comes flying through the air so fast? Tell us, that
we may tell our Rajah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah answered, &ldquo;Go and tell your master that
this is Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s husband, come to visit his
father-in-law.&rdquo; So they took that answer back to the
palace, but when the Rajah heard it, he said, &ldquo;I cannot
tell what this means, for the Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s
husband died long ago. It is twenty years since he
fell upon the iron spears and died; let us, however, all
go and discover who this great Rajah really is.&rdquo; And
he and all his court went out to meet the new-comers,
just as the parrots had alighted close to the palace
gate. The Panch-Phul Ranee took her son by the one
hand and her husband by the other, and walking to
meet her father, said, &ldquo;Father, I have come to see you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
again. This is my husband who died, and this boy is
my son.&rdquo; Then all the land was glad to see the
Panch-Phul Ranee back, and the people said, &ldquo;Our
Princess is the most beautiful Princess in the world,
and her husband is as handsome as she is, and her son
is a fair boy; we will that they should always live
among us and reign over us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they had rested a little, the Panch-Phul
Ranee told her father and mother the story of all her
adventures from the time she and her husband were
left in the palkees in the jungle. And when they had
heard it, her father said to the Rajah, her husband,
&ldquo;You must never go away again; for see, I have no
son but you. You and your son must reign here after
me. And behold all this great kingdom will I now
give you, if you will only stay with us; for I am old
and weary of governing the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Rajah answered, &ldquo;I must return once again
to my own country, and then I will stay with you as
long as I live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, leaving the Panch-Phul Ranee and her son with
the old Rajah and Ranee, he mounted his parrots and
once more returned to his father&rsquo;s land. And when he
had reached it, he said to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, my
father-in-law has given me a kingdom ten thousand
times larger than this. So I have but returned to bid
you farewell and fetch my first wife, and then I must
go back to live in that other land.&rdquo; She answered,
&ldquo;Very well; so you are happy anywhere, I am happy
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then said to his half-brother, &ldquo;Brother, my
father-in-law has given me all the Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s
country, which is very far away; therefore I give up to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
you the half of this kingdom that my father gave to
me.&rdquo; Then, bidding his father farewell, he took the
Carpenter&rsquo;s daughter back with him (riding through
the air on two of the wooden parrots, and followed by
the rest) to the Panch-Phul Ranee&rsquo;s country, and
there he and his two wives and his son lived very
happily all their mortal days.</p>

<i>HOW THE SUN, THE MOON AND THE WIND
WENT OUT TO DINNER.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day the Sun, the Moon and the Wind went
out to dine with their uncle and aunt, the Thunder
and Lightning. Their mother (one of the most
distant Stars you see far up in the sky) waited alone
for her children&rsquo;s return.</p>

<p>Now both the Sun and the Wind were greedy and
selfish. They enjoyed the great feast that had been
prepared for them, without a thought of saving any of
it to take home to their mother; but the gentle Moon
did not forget her. Of every dainty dish that was
brought round she placed a small portion under one of
her beautiful long finger-nails, that the Star might also
have a share in the treat.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>On their return, their mother, who had kept watch
for them all night long with her little bright eye, said,
&ldquo;Well, children, what have you brought home for
me?&rdquo; Then the Sun (who was eldest) said, &ldquo;I have
brought nothing home for you. I went out to enjoy
myself with my friends, not to fetch a dinner for my
mother!&rdquo; And the Wind said, &ldquo;Neither have I brought
anything home for you, mother. You could hardly
expect me to bring a collection of good things for you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
when I merely went out for my own pleasure.&rdquo; But
the Moon said, &ldquo;Mother, fetch a plate; see what I have
brought you.&rdquo; And shaking her hands she showered
down such a choice dinner as never was seen before.</p>

<p>Then the Star turned to the Sun and spoke thus:
&ldquo;Because you went out to amuse yourself with your
friends, and feasted and enjoyed yourself without any
thought of your mother at home, you shall be cursed.
Henceforth, your rays shall ever be hot and scorching,
and shall burn all that they touch. And men shall
hate you and cover their heads when you appear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(And that is why the Sun is so hot to this day.)</p>

<p>Then she turned to the Wind and said: &ldquo;You also,
who forgot your mother in the midst of your selfish
pleasures, hear your doom. You shall always blow in
the hot, dry weather, and shall parch and shrivel all
living things. And men shall detest and avoid you
from this very time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(And that is why the Wind in the hot weather is
still so disagreeable.)</p>

<p>But to the Moon she said: &ldquo;Daughter, because you
remembered your mother, and kept for her a share in
your own enjoyment, from henceforth you shall be
ever cool and calm and bright. No noxious glare shall
accompany your pure rays, and men shall always call
you &lsquo;blessed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>(And that is why the Moon&rsquo;s light is so soft and cool
and beautiful even to this day.)</p>

<br />
<i>SINGH RAJAH AND THE CUNNING LITTLE
JACKALS.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time, in a great jungle, there lived
a great Lion. He was Rajah of all the country
round; and every day he used to leave his den, in the
deepest shadow of the rocks, and roar with a loud,
angry voice; and when he roared, the other animals
in the jungle, who were all his subjects, got very much
frightened and ran here and there; and Singh Rajah
would pounce upon them and kill them, and gobble
them up for his dinner.</p>

<p>This went on for a long, long time, until, at last,
there were no living creatures left in the jungle but two
little Jackals&mdash;a Rajah Jackal and a Ranee Jackal&mdash;husband
and wife.</p>

<p>A very hard time of it the poor little Jackals had,
running this way and that to escape the terrible Singh
Rajah; and every day the little Ranee Jackal would
say to her husband, &ldquo;I am afraid he will catch us to-day;
do you hear how he is roaring? Oh dear! oh
dear!&rdquo; And he would answer her, &ldquo;Never fear; I
will take care of you. Let us run on a mile or two.
Come, come quick, quick, quick.&rdquo; And they would
both run away as fast as they could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
After some time spent in this way, they found, however,
one fine day, that the Lion was so close upon them
that they could not escape. Then the little Ranee
Jackal said, &ldquo;Husband, husband, I feel much frightened.
The Singh Rajah is so angry he will certainly
kill us at once. What can we do?&rdquo; But he answered,
&ldquo;Cheer up; we can save ourselves yet. Come, and
I&rsquo;ll show you how we may manage it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So what did these cunning little Jackals do but they
went to the great Lion&rsquo;s den; and when he saw them
coming, he began to roar and shake his mane, and he
said, &ldquo;You little wretches, come and be eaten at once!
I have had no dinner for three whole days, and all that
time I have been running over hill and dale to find
you. Ro-a-ar! Ro-a-ar! Come and be eaten, I say!&rdquo;
and he lashed his tail and gnashed his teeth, and looked
very terrible indeed. Then the Jackal Rajah, creeping
quite close up to him, said, &ldquo;Oh, great Singh Rajah,
we all know you are our master, and we would have
come at your bidding long ago; but indeed, sir, there
is a much bigger Rajah even than you in this jungle,
and he tried to catch hold of us and eat us up, and
frightened us so much that we were obliged to run
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; growled Singh Rajah.
&ldquo;There is no king in this jungle but me!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah,
sire,&rdquo; answered the Jackal, &ldquo;in truth one would think
so, for you are very dreadful. Your very voice is
death. But it is as we say, for we, with our own eyes,
have seen one with whom you could not compete&mdash;whose
equal you can no more be than we are yours&mdash;whose
face is as flaming fire, his step as thunder, and
his power supreme.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is impossible!&rdquo; interrupted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
the old Lion; &ldquo;but show me this Rajah of whom you
speak so much, that I may destroy him instantly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the little Jackals ran on before him until they
reached a great well, and pointing down to his own
reflection in the water, they said, &ldquo;See, sire, there
lives the terrible king of whom we spoke.&rdquo; When
Singh Rajah looked down the well, he became very
angry, for he thought he saw another Lion there. He
roared and shook his great mane, and the shadow Lion
shook his and looked terribly defiant. At last, beside
himself with rage at the violence of his opponent, Singh
Rajah sprang down to kill him at once, but no other
Lion was there&mdash;only the treacherous reflection&mdash;and
the sides of the well were so steep that he could not
get out again to punish the two Jackals, who peeped
over the top. After struggling for some time in the
deep water, he sank to rise no more. And the little
Jackals threw stones down upon him from above, and
danced round and round the well, singing, &ldquo;Ao! Ao!
Ao! Ao! The King of the Forest is dead, is dead!
We have killed the great Lion who would have killed
us! Ao! Ao! Ao! Ao! Ring-a-ting&mdash;ding-a-ting!
Ring-a-ting&mdash;ding-a-ting! Ao! Ao! Ao!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<h2>XII.<br />
<br />
<i>THE JACKAL, THE BARBER AND THE BRAHMIN
WHO HAD SEVEN DAUGHTERS.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> BARBER and a Jackal once struck up a great
friendship, which might have continued to this
day, had not the Jackal been so clever that the Barber
never felt quite on equal terms with him, and suspected
his friend of playing him many tricks. But this he
was not able to prove.</p>

<p>One day the Jackal said to the Barber, &ldquo;It would be
a nice thing for us to have a garden of our own, in
which we might grow as many cucumbers, pumpkins
and melons as we like. Why should we not buy
one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Barber answered, &ldquo;Very well; here is money.
Do you go and buy us a garden.&rdquo; So the Jackal took
the Barber&rsquo;s money, and with it bought a fine garden,
in which were cucumbers, pumpkins, melons, figs, and
many other good fruits and vegetables. And he used
to go there every day and feast to his heart&rsquo;s content.
When, however, the Barber said to him, &ldquo;What is the
garden like which you bought with the money I gave
you?&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;There are very fine plants in it,
but there is no fruit upon them; when the fruit is ripe
I will let you know.&rdquo; This reply satisfied the Barber,
who inquired no further at that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
A little while afterward, the Barber again asked the
Jackal about the garden, saying, &ldquo;I see you go down
to that garden every day; is the fruit getting ripe?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh dear no, not yet,&rdquo; answered the Jackal; &ldquo;why,
the plants are only just coming into blossom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But all this time there was a great deal of fruit in
the garden, and the Jackal went there every day and
ate as much as he could.</p>

<p>Again, a third time, when some weeks had passed,
the Barber said to him, &ldquo;Is there no ripe fruit in our
garden yet?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Jackal; &ldquo;the blossoms
have only just fallen, but the fruit is forming. In time
we shall have a fine show of melons and figs there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Barber began to think the Jackal was deceiving
him, and determined to see and judge for himself.
So next day, without saying anything about it,
he followed him down to the garden.</p>

<p>Now it happened that very day the Jackal had invited
all his friends to come and feast there. All the
animals in the neighboring jungle had accepted the
invitation; there they came trooping by hundreds and
dozens, and were very merry indeed&mdash;running here
and there, and eating all the melons and cucumbers
and figs and pumpkins in the place.</p>

<p>The Barber peeped over the hedge, and saw the
assembled wild beasts, and his friend the Jackal entertaining
them&mdash;talking to this one, laughing with that,
and eating with all. The good man did not dare to
attack the intruders, as they were many and powerful.
But he went home at once, very angry, muttering to
himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the death of that young jackanapes;
he shall play no more pranks in my garden.&rdquo; And,
watching his opportunity, he returned there when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
Jackal and all his friends had left, and tied a long
knife to the largest of the cucumbers that still remained;
then he went home and said nothing of what
he had seen.</p>

<p>Early next morning the Jackal thought to himself,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just run down to the garden and see if there are
no cucumbers or melons left.&rdquo; So he went there, and,
picking out the largest of the cucumbers, began to eat
it. Quick as thought, the long knife, that was concealed
by the cucumber leaves, ran into him, cutting
his muzzle, his neck and his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that nasty Barber!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;this must be
his doing!&rdquo; And instead of going home, he ran as
fast as he could, very far, far, away into the jungle, and
stretching himself out on a great flat rock, prepared
to die.</p>

<p>But he did not die. Only for three whole days the
pain in his neck and side was so great that he could
not move; moreover, he felt very weak from loss of
blood.</p>

<p>At the end of the third day he tried to get up, but
his own blood had sealed him to the stone! He endeavored
to move it by his struggles, but could not succeed.
&ldquo;Oh dear! oh dear!&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;to think
that I should recover from my wound, only to die such
a horrible death as this! Ah me! here is the punishment
of dishonesty!&rdquo; And, having said this, he began
to weep. It chanced, however, that the god of Rain
heard his lamentations, and taking pity on the unfortunate
animal, he sent a kindly shower, which, wetting
the stone, effected his release.</p>

<p>No sooner was the Jackal set free than he began to
think what he could do to earn a livelihood, since he did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
not dare return to the Barber&rsquo;s house. It was not long
before a feasible plan struck him: all around was the
mud made by the recent rain; he placed a quantity of
it in a small chattee, covered the top over carefully
with leaves (as people do jars of fresh butter), and took
it into a neighboring village to sell.</p>

<p>At the door of one of the first houses to which he
came stood a woman, to whom the Jackal said, &ldquo;Mahi,
here is butter&mdash;beautiful fresh butter! won&rsquo;t you buy
some fresh butter?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;Are you sure it
is quite fresh? Let me see it.&rdquo; But he replied, &ldquo;It is
perfectly fresh; but if you open the chattee now, it
will be all spoilt by the time you want it. If you like
to buy it, you may take it; if not, I will sell it to some
one else.&rdquo; The woman did want some fresh butter,
and the chattee the Jackal carried on his head was carefully
fastened up, as if what it contained was of the
best; and she knew if she opened it, it might spoil
before her husband returned home; besides, she thought,
if the Jackal had intended to deceive her, he would
have been more pressing in asking her to buy it. So
she said, &ldquo;Very well, give me the chattee; here is
money for you. You are sure it is the best butter?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is the best of its kind,&rdquo; answered the Jackal;
&ldquo;only be sure you put it in some cool place, and don&rsquo;t
open it till it is wanted.&rdquo; And taking the money, he
ran away.</p>

<p>A short time afterward the woman discovered how
she had been cheated, and was very angry; but the
Jackal was by that time far away, out of reach of
punishment.</p>

<p>When his money was spent, the Jackal felt puzzled
as to how to get a living, since no one would give him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
food and he could buy none. Fortunately for him, just
then one of the bullocks belonging to the village died.
The Jackal found it lying dead by the road-side, and
he began to eat it, and ate, and ate so much that at last
he had got too far into the animal&rsquo;s body to be seen by
passers-by. Now the weather was hot and dry. Whilst
the Jackal was in it, the bullock&rsquo;s skin crinkled up so
tightly with the heat that it became too hard for him
to bite through, and so he could not get out again.</p>

<p>The Mahars<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> of the village all came out to bury the
dead bullock. The Jackal, who was inside it, feared
that if they caught him they would kill him, and that
if they did not discover him, he would be buried alive;
so on their approach he called out, &ldquo;People, people,
take care how you touch me, for I am a great saint.&rdquo;
The poor people were very much frightened when they
heard the dead bullock talking, and thought that some
mighty spirit must indeed possess it.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> &ldquo;Who are you,
sir, and what do you want?&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;I,&rdquo; answered
the Jackal, &ldquo;am a very holy saint. I am also
the god of your village, and I am very angry with you
because you never worship me nor bring me offerings.&rdquo;
&ldquo;O my Lord,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;what offerings will please
you? Tell us only, and we will bring you whatever
you like.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Then you must
fetch here plenty of rice, plenty of flowers and a nice
fat chicken; place them as an offering beside me, and
pour a great deal of water over them, as you do at your
most solemn feasts, and I will forgive you your sins.&rdquo;
The Mahars did as they were commanded. They
placed some rice and flowers, and the best chicken they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
could procure, beside the bullock, and poured water
over it and the offering. Then, no sooner did the dry,
hard bullock&rsquo;s skin get wetted than it split in many
places, and to the surprise of all his worshipers, the
Jackal jumped out, seized the chicken in his mouth,
and ran away with it through the midst of them into
the jungle. The Mahars ran after him over hedges and
ditches for many, many miles, but he got away in spite
of them all.</p>

<p>On, on he ran&mdash;on, on, for a very long way&mdash;until
at last he came to a place where a little kid lived under
a little sicakai<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> tree. All her relations and friends
were away, and when she saw him coming she thought
to herself, &ldquo;Unless I frighten this Jackal, he will eat
me.&rdquo; So she ran as hard as she could up against the
sicakai tree, which made all the branches shake and
the leaves go rustle, rustle, rustle. And when the
Jackal heard the rustling noise he got frightened, and
thought it was all the little kid&rsquo;s friends coming to help
her. And she called out to him, &ldquo;Run away, Jackal,
run away. Thousands and thousands of Jackals have
run away at that sound&mdash;run away for your life.&rdquo; And
the Jackal was so frightened that he ran away. So, he
who had deceived so many was outwitted by a simple
little kid!</p>

<p>After this the Jackal found his way back to his own
village, where the Barber lived, and there for some
time he used to prowl round the houses every night
and live upon any bones he could find. The villagers
did not like his coming, but did not know how to catch
him, until one night his old friend the Barber (who
had never forgiven him for stealing the fruit from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
garden) caught him in a great net, having before made
many unsuccessful attempts to do so. &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; cried
the Barber, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you at last, my friend. You
did not escape death from the cucumber-knife for nothing!
you won&rsquo;t get away this time. Here, wife! wife!
see what a prize I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo; The Barber&rsquo;s wife came
running to the door, and the Barber gave her the
Jackal (after he had tied all his four legs firmly together
with a strong rope), and said to her, &ldquo;Take
this animal into the house, and be sure you don&rsquo;t let
him escape, while I go and get a knife to kill him
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Barber&rsquo;s wife did as she was bid, and taking the
Jackal into the house, laid him down on the floor.
But no sooner had the Barber gone than the Jackal
said to her, &ldquo;Ah, good woman, your husband will return
directly and put me to death. For the love of
heaven, loosen the rope round my feet before he comes,
for one minute only, and let me drink a little water
from that puddle by the door, for my throat is parched
with thirst.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no, friend Jackal,&rdquo; answered the
Barber&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;I know well enough what you&rsquo;ll do.
No sooner shall I have untied your feet than you will
run away, and when my husband returns and finds you
are gone, he will beat me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, indeed, I will not run away,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;Ah, kind mother, have pity on me, only for
one little moment.&rdquo; Then the Barber&rsquo;s wife thought,
&ldquo;Well, it is hard not to grant the poor beast&rsquo;s last request;
he will not live long enough to have many more
pleasures.&rdquo; So she untied the Jackal&rsquo;s legs and held
him by a rope, that he might drink from the puddle.
But quick as possible, he gave a jump and a twist and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
a pull, and, jerking the rope out of her hand, escaped
once more into the jungle.</p>

<p>For some time he roamed up and down, living on
what he could get in this village or that, until he had
wandered very far away from the country where the
Barber lived. At last one day, by chance, he passed a
certain cottage, in which there dwelt a very poor Brahmin,
who had seven daughters.</p>

<p>As the Jackal passed by, the Brahmin was saying to
himself, &ldquo;Oh dear me! what can I do for my seven
daughters? I shall have to support them all my life,
for they are much too poor ever to get married. If a
dog or a jackal were to offer to take one off my hands,
he should have her.&rdquo; Next day the Jackal called on
the Brahmin, and said to him, &ldquo;You said yesterday, if
a jackal or a dog were to offer to marry one of your
daughters, you would let him have her; will you,
therefore accept me as a son-in-law?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor Brahmin felt very much embarrassed, but
it was certain he had said the words, and therefore he
felt in honor bound not to retract, although he had little
dreamed of ever being placed in such a predicament.
Just at that moment all the seven daughters
began crying for bread, and the father had no bread to
give them. Observing this, the Jackal continued,
&ldquo;Let me marry one of your seven daughters and I will
take care of her. It will at least leave you one less to
provide for, and I will see that she never needs food.&rdquo;
Then the Brahmin&rsquo;s heart was softened, and he gave
the Jackal his eldest daughter in marriage, and the
Jackal took her home to his den in the high rocks.</p>

<p>Now you will say there never was a Jackal so clever
as this. Very true, for this was not a common Jackal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
or he could never have done all that I have told you.
This Jackal was, in fact, a great Rajah in disguise,
who, to amuse himself, took the form of a Jackal; for
he was a great magician as well as a great prince.</p>

<p>The den to which he took the Brahmin&rsquo;s daughter
looked like quite a common hole in the rocks on the
outside, but inside it was a splendid palace, adorned
with silver, and gold, and ivory and precious stones.
But even his own wife did not know that he was not
always a Jackal, for the Rajah never took his human
form except every morning very early, when he used
to take off the jackal skin and wash it and brush it,
and put it on again.</p>

<p>After he and his wife, the Brahmin&rsquo;s daughter, had
lived up in their home in the rocks happily for some
time, who should the Jackal see one day but his father-in-law,
the old Brahmin, climbing up the hill to come
and pay him a visit. The Jackal was vexed to see the
Brahmin, for he knew he was very poor, and thought
he had most likely come to beg; and so it was. The
Brahmin said to him, &ldquo;Son-in-law, let me come into
your cave and rest a little while. I want to ask you to
help me, for I am very poor and much in need of
help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go into my cave,&rdquo; said the Jackal; &ldquo;it is but
a poor hole, not fit for you to enter&rdquo; (for he did not wish
his father-in-law to see his fine palace); &ldquo;but I will
call my wife, that you may see I have not eaten her up,
and she and you and I will talk over the matter, and
see what we can do for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Brahmin, the Brahmin&rsquo;s daughter and the
Jackal all sat down on the hill-side together, and the
Brahmin said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do to get food
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
for myself, my wife and my six daughters. Son-in-law
Jackal, cannot you help me?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is a difficult
business,&rdquo; answered the Jackal, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll do what I
can for you;&rdquo; and he ran to his cave and fetched a
large melon, and gave it to the Brahmin, saying,
&ldquo;Father-in-law, you must take this melon, and plant it
in your garden, and when it grows up sell all the fruit
you find upon it, and that will bring you in some
money.&rdquo; So the Brahmin took the melon home with
him and planted it in his garden.</p>

<p>By next day the melon that the Jackal had given
him had grown up in the Brahmin&rsquo;s garden into a fine
plant, covered with hundreds of beautiful ripe melons.
The Brahmin, his wife and family were overjoyed at
the sight. And all the neighbors were astonished, and
said, &ldquo;How fast that fine melon plant has grown in
the Brahmin&rsquo;s garden!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it chanced that a woman who lived in a house
close by wanted some melons, and seeing what fine ones
these were, she went down at once to the Brahmin&rsquo;s
house and bought two or three from the Brahmin&rsquo;s
wife. She took them home with her and cut them
open; but then, lo and behold! marvel of marvels!
what a wonderful sight astonished her! Instead of the
thick white pulp she expected to see, the whole of the
inside of the melon was composed of diamonds, rubies
and emeralds, and all the seeds were enormous pearls.
She immediately locked her door, and taking with her
all the money she had, ran back to the Brahmin&rsquo;s wife
and said to her, &ldquo;Those were very good melons you
sold me; I like them so much that I will buy all the
others on your melon plant.&rdquo; And giving her the
money, she took home all the rest of the melons. Now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
this cunning woman told none of her friends of the
treasure she had found, and the poor, stupid Brahmin
and his family did not know what they had lost, for
they had never thought of opening any of the melons;
so that for all the precious stones they sold they only
got a few pice, which was very hard. Next day, when
they looked out of the window, the melon plant was
again covered with fine ripe melons, and again the
woman who had bought those which had grown the
day before came and bought them all. And this went
on for several days. There were so many melons, and
all the melons were so full of precious stones, that the
woman who bought them had enough to fill the whole
of one room in her house with diamonds, rubies, emeralds
and pearls.</p>

<p>At last, however, the wonderful melon plant began
to wither, and when the woman came to buy melons
one morning, the Brahmin&rsquo;s wife was obliged to say to
her, in a sad voice, &ldquo;Alas! there are no more melons
on our melon plant.&rdquo; And the woman went back to
her own house very much disappointed.</p>

<p>That day the Brahmin and his wife and children had
no money in the house to buy food with, and they all
felt very unhappy to think that the fine melon plant had
withered. But the Brahmin&rsquo;s youngest daughter, who
was a clever girl, thought, &ldquo;Though there are no more
melons fit to sell on our melon plant, perhaps I may be
able to find one or two shriveled ones, which, if cooked,
will give us something for dinner.&rdquo; So she went out
to look, and searching carefully amongst the thick leaves,
found two or three withered little melons still remaining.
These she took into the house and began cutting them
up to cook, when&mdash;more wonderful than wonderful!&mdash;within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
each little melon she found a number of small
emeralds, rubies, diamonds and pearls! The girl called
her father and mother, and her five sisters, crying, &ldquo;See
what I have found! See these precious stones and
pearls. I dare say inside all the melons we sold there
were as good or better than these. No wonder that
woman was so anxious to buy them all! See, father&mdash;see,
mother&mdash;see, sisters!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they were all overjoyed to see the treasure, but
the Brahmin said, &ldquo;What a pity we have lost all the
benefit of my son-in-law the Jackal&rsquo;s good gift by not
knowing its worth! I will go at once to that woman,
and try and make her give us back the melons she
took.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he went to the melon-buyer&rsquo;s house, and said to
her, &ldquo;Give me back the melons you took from me, who
did not know their worth.&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what you mean.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;You were very
deceitful; you bought melons full of precious stones
from us poor people, who did not know what they were
worth, and you only paid for them the price of common
melons: give me some of them back, I pray you.&rdquo;
But she said, &ldquo;I bought common melons from your
wife, and made them all into common soup long ago;
therefore talk no further nonsense about jewels, but go
about your business.&rdquo; And she turned him out of the
house. Yet all this time she had a whole roomful of
the emeralds, diamonds, rubies and pearls that she had
found in the melons the Brahmin&rsquo;s wife had sold her.</p>

<p>The Brahmin returned home and said to his wife, &ldquo;I
cannot make that woman give me back any of the
melons you sold her; but give me the precious stones
our daughter has just found, and I will sell them to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
jeweler and bring home some money.&rdquo; So he went to
the town, and took the precious stones to a jeweler, and
said to him, &ldquo;What will you give me for these?&rdquo; But
no sooner did the jeweler see them than he said, &ldquo;How
could such a poor man as you become possessed of
such precious stones? You must have stolen them:
you are a thief! You have stolen these from my shop,
and now come to sell them to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, sir; indeed no, sir,&rdquo; cried the Brahmin.
&ldquo;Thief, thief!&rdquo; shouted the jeweler. &ldquo;In truth, no
sir,&rdquo; said the Brahmin; &ldquo;my son-in-law, the Jackal,
gave me a melon plant, and in one of the melons I
found these jewels.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word you say,&rdquo;
screamed the jeweler (and he began beating the Brahmin,
whom he held by the arm); &ldquo;give up those jewels
which you have stolen from my shop.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
roared the Brahmin; &ldquo;oh! oh-o! oh-o-o! don&rsquo;t beat
me so; I didn&rsquo;t steal them.&rdquo; But the jeweler was
determined to get the jewels; so he beat the Brahmin
and called the police, who came running up to his assistance,
and shouted till a great crowd of people had
collected round his shop. Then he said to the Brahmin,
&ldquo;Give me up the jewels you stole from me, or I&rsquo;ll give
you to the police, and you shall be put in jail.&rdquo; The
Brahmin tried to tell his story about his son-in-law, the
Jackal, but of course nobody believed him; and he was
obliged to give the precious stones to the jeweler in
order to escape the police, and to run home as fast as
he could. And every one thought the jeweler was very
kind to let him off so easily.</p>

<p>All his family were very unhappy when they heard
what had befallen him. But his wife said, &ldquo;You had
better go again to our son-in-law, the Jackal, and see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
what he can do for us.&rdquo; So next day the Brahmin
climbed the hill again, as he had done before, and
went to call upon the Jackal. When the Jackal saw
him coming he was not very well pleased. So he went
to meet him, and said, &ldquo;Father-in-law, I did not expect
to see you again so soon.&rdquo; &ldquo;I merely came to see how
you were,&rdquo; answered the Brahmin, &ldquo;and to tell you
how poor we are; and how glad we should be of any
help you can give us.&rdquo; &ldquo;What have you done with
all the melons I gave you?&rdquo; asked the Jackal. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;
answered the Brahmin, &ldquo;that is a sad story!&rdquo; And
beginning at the beginning, he related how they had
sold almost all the melons without knowing their value;
and how the few precious stones they had found had
been taken from him by the jeweler. When the Jackal
heard this he laughed very much, and said, &ldquo;I see it is
no use giving such unfortunate people as you gold or
jewels, for they will only bring you into trouble. Come,
I&rsquo;ll give you a more useful present.&rdquo; So, running into
his cave, he fetched thence a small chattee, and gave it
to the Brahmin, saying, &ldquo;Take this chattee; whenever
you or any of the family are hungry, you will always
find in it as good a dinner as this.&rdquo; And putting his
paw into the chattee, he extracted thence currie and
rice, pilau,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and all sorts of good things, enough to
feast a hundred men; and the more he took out of the
chattee, the more remained inside.</p>

<p>When the Brahmin saw the chattee and smelt the
good dinner, his eyes glistened for joy; and he embraced
the Jackal, saying, &ldquo;Dear son-in-law, you are
the only support of our house.&rdquo; And he took his new
present carefully home with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
After this, for some time, the whole family led a very happy
life, for they never wanted good food; every
day the Brahmin, his wife and his six daughters found
inside the chattee a most delicious dinner; and every
day, when they had dined, they placed it on a shelf, to
find it replenished when next it was needed.</p>

<p>But it happened that hard by there lived another
Brahmin, a very great man, who was much in the
Rajah&rsquo;s confidence; and this man smelt daily the smell
of a very nice dinner, which puzzled him a good deal.
The rich Brahmin thought it smelt even nicer than his
own dinner, for which he paid so much, and yet it
seemed to come from the poor Brahmin&rsquo;s little cottage.
So one day he determined to find out all about it; and,
going to call on his neighbor, he said to him, &ldquo;Every
day, at about twelve o&rsquo;clock, I smell such a very nice
dinner&mdash;much nicer than my own; and it seems to
come from your house. You must live on very good
things, I think, although you seem to every one to be
so very poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, in the pride of his heart, the poor Brahmin
invited his rich neighbor to come and dine with him,
and lifting the magic chattee down from the shelf, took
out of it such delicate fare as the other had never before
tasted. And in an evil hour he proceeded to tell his
friend of the wondrous properties of the chattee, which
his son-in-law, the Jackal, had given him, and how it
never was empty. No sooner had the great man learnt
all this than he went to the Rajah, and said to him,
&ldquo;There is a poor Brahmin in the town who possesses
a wonderful chattee, which is always filled with the
most delicious dinner. I should not feel authorized to
deprive him of it; but if it pleased your Highness to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
take it from him, he could not complain.&rdquo; The Rajah,
hearing this, determined to see and taste for himself.
So he said, &ldquo;I should very much like to see this chattee
with my own eyes.&rdquo; And he accompanied the rich
Brahmin to the poor Brahmin&rsquo;s house. The poor
Brahmin was overjoyed at being noticed by the Rajah
himself, and gladly exhibited the various excellences
of the chattee; but no sooner did the Rajah taste the
dinner it contained than he ordered his guards to seize
it and take it away to the palace, in spite of the Brahmin&rsquo;s
tears and protestations. Thus, for a second
time, he lost the benefit of his son-in-law&rsquo;s gift.</p>

<p>When the Rajah had gone, the Brahmin said to his
wife, &ldquo;There is nothing to be done but to go again to
the Jackal, and see if he can help us.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t
take care, you&rsquo;ll put him out of all patience at last,&rdquo;
answered she. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why you need have gone
talking about our chattee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the Jackal heard the Brahmin&rsquo;s story, he became
very cross, and said, &ldquo;What a stupid old man
you were to say anything about the chattee! But see,
here is another, which may aid you to get back the
first. Take care of it, for this is the last time I will
help you.&rdquo; And he gave the Brahmin a chattee, in
which was a stout stick tied to a very strong rope.
&ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;into the presence of those who
deprived you of my other gifts, and when you open the
chattee, command the stick to beat them; this it will
do so effectually that they will gladly return you what
you have lost; only take care not to open the chattee
when you are alone, or the stick that is in it will
punish your rashness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Brahmin thanked his son-in-law, and took away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
the chattee, but he found it hard to believe all that had
been said. So, going through the jungle on his way
home, he uncovered it, just to peep in and see if the
stick were really there. No sooner had he done this
than out jumped the rope, out jumped the stick; the
rope seized him and bound him to a tree, and the stick
beat him, and beat him, and beat him, until he was
nearly killed. &ldquo;Oh dear! oh dear!&rdquo; screamed the
Brahmin; &ldquo;what an unlucky man I am! Oh dear!
oh dear! stop, please stop! good stick, stop! what a
very good stick this is!&rdquo; But the stick would not stop,
but beat him so much that he could hardly crawl home
again.</p>

<p>Then the Brahmin put the rope and stick back again
into the chattee, and sent to his rich neighbor and to
the Rajah, and said to them, &ldquo;I have a new chattee,
much better than the old one; do come and see what
a fine one it is.&rdquo; And the rich Brahmin and the Rajah
thought, &ldquo;This is something good; doubtless there is
a choice dinner in this chattee also, and we will take
it from this foolish man, as we did the other.&rdquo; So
they went down to meet the Brahmin in the jungle,
taking with them all their followers and attendants.
Then the Brahmin uncovered his chattee, saying,
&ldquo;Beat, stick, beat! beat them every one!&rdquo; and the
stick jumped out, and the rope jumped out, and the
rope caught hold of the Rajah and the rich Brahmin
and all their attendants, and tied them fast to the trees
that grew around, and the stick ran from one to another,
beating, beating, beating&mdash;beating the Rajah,
beating his courtiers&mdash;beating the rich Brahmin, beating
his attendants, and beating all their followers;
while the poor Brahmin cried with all his might,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
&ldquo;Give me back my chattee! give me back my
chattee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the Rajah and his people were very much
frightened, and thought they were going to be killed.
And the Rajah said to the Brahmin, &ldquo;Take away your
stick, only take away your stick, and you shall have
back your chattee.&rdquo; So the Brahmin put the stick
and rope back into the chattee, and the Rajah returned
him the dinner-making chattee. And all the people
felt very much afraid of the Brahmin, and respected
him very much.</p>

<p>Then he took the chattee containing the rope and
stick to the house of the woman who had bought the
melons, and the rope caught her and the stick beat her;
and the Brahmin cried, &ldquo;Return me those melons! return
me those melons!&rdquo; And the woman said, &ldquo;Only
make your stick stop beating me and you shall have
back all the melons.&rdquo; So he ordered the stick back
into the chattee, and she returned him them forthwith&mdash;a
whole roomful of melons full of diamonds, pearls,
emeralds and rubies.</p>

<p>The Brahmin took them home to his wife, and going
into the town, with the help of his good stick, forced
the jeweler who had deprived him of the little emeralds,
rubies, diamonds and pearls he had taken to sell to give
them back to him again, and having accomplished this,
he returned to his family; and from that time they all
lived very happily. Then, one day, the Jackal&rsquo;s wife
invited her six sisters to come and pay her a visit.
Now the youngest sister was more clever than any of
the others; and it happened that, very early in the
morning, she saw her brother-in-law, the Jackal, take
off the jackal skin and wash it and brush it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
hang it up to dry; and when he had taken off the
jackal-skin coat, he looked the handsomest prince that
ever was seen. Then his little sister-in-law ran, quickly
and quietly, and stole away the jackal-skin coat, and
threw it on the fire and burnt it. And she awoke
her sister, and said, &ldquo;Sister, sister, your husband
is no longer a jackal; see, that is he standing by
the door.&rdquo; So the Jackal Rajah&rsquo;s wife ran to the door
to meet her husband, and because the jackal&rsquo;s skin was
burnt, and he could wear it no longer, he continued to
be a man for the rest of his life, and gave up playing
all jackal-like pranks; and he and his wife, and his
father and mother and sisters-in-law, lived very happily
all the rest of their days.</p>

<i>TIT FOR TAT.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE once lived a Camel and a Jackal who
were great friends. One day the Jackal said to
the Camel, &ldquo;I know that there is a fine field of sugar-cane
on the other side of the river. If you will take me
across, I&rsquo;ll show you the place. This plan will suit me
as well as you. You will enjoy eating the sugar-cane,
and I am sure to find many crabs, bones and bits of fish
by the river-side, on which to make a good dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Camel consented and swam across the river,
taking the Jackal, who could not swim, on his back.
When they reached the other side, the Camel went to
eating the sugar-cane, and the Jackal ran up and down
the river bank devouring all the crabs, bits of fish and
bones he could find.</p>

<p>But being so much smaller an animal, he had made
an excellent meal before the Camel had eaten more
than two or three mouthfuls; and no sooner had he
finished his dinner than he ran round and round the
sugar-cane field, yelping and howling with all his
might.</p>

<p>The villagers heard him, and thought, &ldquo;There is a
Jackal among the sugar-canes; he will be scratching
holes in the ground and spoiling the roots of the plants.&rdquo;
And they all went down to the place to drive him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
away. But when they got there they found to their
surprise not only a Jackal, but a Camel who was eating
the sugar-canes! This made them very angry, and
they caught the poor Camel and drove him from the field
and beat him and beat him, until he was nearly dead.</p>

<p>When they had gone, the Jackal said to the Camel,
&ldquo;We had better go home.&rdquo; And the Camel said,
&ldquo;Very well; then jump upon my back, as you did
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Jackal jumped upon the Camel&rsquo;s back, and
the Camel began to recross the river. When they had
got well into the water, the Camel said, &ldquo;This is a
pretty way in which you have treated me, friend Jackal.
No sooner had you finished your own dinner than you
must go yelping about the place loud enough to arouse
the whole village, and bring all the villagers down to
beat me black and blue, and turn me out of the field
before I had eaten two mouthfuls! What in the world
did you make such a noise for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the Jackal. &ldquo;It is a custom
I have. I always like to sing a little after dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Camel waded on through the river. The water
reached up to his knees&mdash;then above them&mdash;up, up, up,
higher and higher, until he was obliged to swim. Then
turning to the Jackal, he said, &ldquo;I feel very anxious to
roll.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, pray don&rsquo;t; why do you wish to do so?&rdquo;
asked the Jackal. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the
Camel. &ldquo;It is a custom I have. I always like to have
a little roll after dinner.&rdquo; So saying, he rolled over in
the water, shaking the Jackal off as he did so. And
the Jackal was drowned, but the Camel swam safely
ashore.</p>

<h2>XIV.<br />
<br />
<i>THE BRAHMIN, THE TIGER AND THE SIX
JUDGES.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time, a Brahmin, who was walking along
the road, came upon an iron cage, in
which a great Tiger had been shut up by the villagers
who caught him.</p>

<p>As the Brahmin passed by, the Tiger called out and
said to him, &ldquo;Brother Brahmin, brother Brahmin, have
pity on me, and let me out of this cage for one minute
only to drink a little water, for I am dying of thirst.&rdquo;
The Brahmin answered, &ldquo;No, I will not; for if I let
you out of the cage you will eat me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, father of mercy,&rdquo; answered the Tiger, &ldquo;in
truth that will I not. I will never be so ungrateful;
only let me out, that I may drink some water and return.&rdquo;
Then the Brahmin took pity on him and opened
the cage door; but no sooner had he done so than the
Tiger, jumping out, said, &ldquo;Now, I will eat you first
and drink the water afterward.&rdquo; But the Brahmin
said, &ldquo;Only do not kill me hastily. Let us first ask the
opinion of six, and if all of them say it is just and fair
that you should put me to death, then I am willing to
die.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the Tiger, &ldquo;it shall be
as you say; we will first ask the opinion of six.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Brahmin and the Tiger walked on till they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
came to a Banyan tree; and the Brahmin said to it,
&ldquo;Banyan tree, Banyan tree, hear and give judgment.&rdquo;
&ldquo;On what must I give judgment?&rdquo; asked the Banyan
tree. &ldquo;This Tiger,&rdquo; said the Brahmin, &ldquo;begged me
to let him out of his cage to drink a little water, and he
promised not to hurt me if I did so; but now, that I
have let him out, he wishes to eat me. Is it just that
he should do so or no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Banyan tree answered, &ldquo;Men often come to
take shelter in the cool shade under my boughs from
the scorching rays of the sun; but when they have
rested, they cut and break my pretty branches and
wantonly scatter my leaves. Let the Tiger eat the man,
for men are an ungrateful race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words the Tiger would have instantly killed
the Brahmin; but the Brahmin said, &ldquo;Tiger, Tiger,
you must not kill me yet, for you promised that we
should first hear the judgment of six.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo;
said the Tiger, and they went on their way. After a
little while they met a Camel. &ldquo;Sir Camel, Sir
Camel,&rdquo; cried the Brahmin, &ldquo;hear and give judgment.&rdquo;
&ldquo;On what shall I give judgment?&rdquo; asked the Camel.
And the Brahmin related how the Tiger had begged
him to open the cage door, and promised not to eat him
if he did so; and how he had afterward determined to
break his word, and asked if that were just or not.
The Camel replied, &ldquo;When I was young and strong,
and could do much work, my master took care of me
and gave me good food; but now that I am old, and
have lost all my strength in his service, he overloads
me and starves me, and beats me without mercy. Let
the Tiger eat the man, for men are an unjust and cruel
race.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
The Tiger would then have killed the Brahmin, but
the latter said, &ldquo;Stop, Tiger, for we must first hear the
judgment of six.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they both went again on their way. At a little
distance they found a Bullock lying by the road-side.
The Brahmin said to him, &ldquo;Brother Bullock, brother
Bullock, hear and give judgment.&rdquo; &ldquo;On what must I
give judgment?&rdquo; asked the Bullock. The Brahmin
answered, &ldquo;I found this Tiger in a cage, and he prayed
me to open the door and let him out to drink a little
water, and promised not to kill me if I did so; but
when I had let him out he resolved to put me to death.
Is it fair he should do so or no?&rdquo; The Bullock said,
&ldquo;When I was able to work my master fed me well and
tended me carefully, but now I am old he has forgotten
all I did for him, and left me by the road-side to die.
Let the Tiger eat the man, for men have no pity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three out of the six had given judgment against the
Brahmin, but still he did not lose all hope, and determined
to ask the other three.</p>

<p>They next met an Eagle flying through the air, to
whom the Brahmin cried, &ldquo;O Eagle, great Eagle, hear
and give judgment?&rdquo; &ldquo;On what must I give judgment?&rdquo;
asked the Eagle. The Brahmin stated the
case, but the Eagle answered, &ldquo;Whenever men see me
they try to shoot me; they climb the rocks and steal
away my little ones. Let the Tiger eat the man, for
men are the persecutors of the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Tiger began to roar, and said, &ldquo;The judgment
of all is against you, O Brahmin.&rdquo; But the
Brahmin answered, &ldquo;Stay yet a little longer, for two
others must first be asked.&rdquo; After this they saw an
Alligator, and the Brahmin related the matter to him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
hoping for a more favorable verdict. But the Alligator
said, &ldquo;Whenever I put my nose out of the water
men torment me and try to kill me. Let the Tiger eat
the man, for as long as men live we shall have no
rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Brahmin gave himself up as lost; but again he
prayed the Tiger to have patience and let him ask the
opinion of the sixth judge. Now the sixth was a
Jackal. The Brahmin told his story, and said to him,
&ldquo;Mama<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Jackal, mama Jackal, say what is your judgment?&rdquo;
The Jackal answered, &ldquo;It is impossible for
me to decide who is in the right and who in the wrong
unless I see the exact position in which you were when
the dispute began. Show me the place.&rdquo; So the
Brahmin and the Tiger returned to the place where
they first met, and the Jackal went with them. When
they got there, the Jackal said, &ldquo;Now, Brahmin, show
me exactly where you stood.&rdquo; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the Brahmin,
standing by the iron tiger-cage. &ldquo;Exactly there,
was it?&rdquo; asked the Jackal. &ldquo;Exactly here,&rdquo; replied
the Brahmin. &ldquo;Where was the Tiger, then?&rdquo; asked
the Jackal. &ldquo;In the cage,&rdquo; answered the Tiger.
&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; said the Jackal; &ldquo;how were you
within the cage? which way were you looking?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, I stood so,&rdquo; said the Tiger, jumping into the
cage, &ldquo;and my head was on this side.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo;
said the Jackal, &ldquo;but I cannot judge without understanding
the whole matter exactly. Was the cage door
open or shut?&rdquo; &ldquo;Shut and bolted,&rdquo; said the Brahmin.
&ldquo;Then shut and bolt it,&rdquo; said the Jackal.</p>

<p>When the Brahmin had done this, the Jackal said,
&ldquo;Oh, you wicked and ungrateful Tiger! when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
good Brahmin opened your cage door, is to eat him the
only return you would make? Stay there, then, for
the rest of your days, for no one will ever let you out
again. Proceed on your journey, friend Brahmin.
Your road lies that way and mine this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, the Jackal ran off in one direction, and
the Brahmin went rejoicing on his way in the other.</p>

<br />
<i>THE SELFISH SPARROW AND THE HOUSELESS
CROWS.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> SPARROW once built a nice little house for
herself, and lined it well with wool and protected
it with sticks, so that it equally resisted the summer sun
and the winter rains. A Crow who lived close by had
also built a house, but it was not such a good one,
being only made of a few sticks laid one above another
on the top of a prickly pear hedge. The consequence
was, that one day, when there was an unusually heavy
shower, the Crow&rsquo;s nest was washed away, while the
Sparrow&rsquo;s was not at all injured.</p>

<p>In this extremity the Crow and her mate went to the
Sparrow, and said, &ldquo;Sparrow, Sparrow, have pity on
us and give us shelter, for the wind blows and the rain
beats, and the prickly pear hedge thorns stick into our
eyes.&rdquo; But the Sparrow answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cooking the
dinner; I cannot let you in now; come again presently.&rdquo;
In a little while the Crows returned, and
said, &ldquo;Sparrow, Sparrow, have pity on us and give us
shelter, for the wind blows and the rain beats, and the
prickly pear hedge thorns stick into our eyes.&rdquo; The
Sparrow answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m eating my dinner; I cannot
let you in now; come again presently.&rdquo; The Crows
flew away, but in a little while returned, and cried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
once more, &ldquo;Sparrow, Sparrow, have pity on us and
give us shelter, for the wind blows and the rain beats,
and the prickly pear hedge thorns stick into our eyes.&rdquo;
The Sparrow replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m washing the dishes; I cannot
let you in now; come again presently.&rdquo; The
Crows waited a while and then called out, &ldquo;Sparrow,
Sparrow, have pity on us and give us shelter, for the
wind blows and the rain beats, and the prickly pear
hedge thorns stick into our eyes.&rdquo; But the Sparrow
would not let them in; she only answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sweeping
the floor; I cannot let you in now; come again
presently.&rdquo; Next time the Crows came and cried,
&ldquo;Sparrow, Sparrow, have pity on us and give us
shelter, for the wind blows and the rain beats, and the
prickly pear hedge thorns stick into our eyes.&rdquo; She answered,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m making the beds; I cannot let you in
now; come again presently.&rdquo; So, on one pretence or
another, she refused to help the poor birds. At last,
when she and her children had had their dinner, and
she had prepared and put away the dinner for next day,
and had put all the children to bed and gone to
bed herself, she cried to the Crows, &ldquo;You may come
in now, and take shelter for the night.&rdquo; The Crows
came in, but they were much vexed at having been kept
out so long in the wind and the rain, and when the
Sparrow and all her family were asleep, the one said
to the other, &ldquo;This selfish Sparrow had no pity on us;
she gave us no dinner, and would not let us in till she
and all her children were comfortably in bed; let us
punish her.&rdquo; So the two Crows took all the nice dinner
the Sparrow had prepared for herself and her children
to eat next day, and flew away with it.</p>

<h2>XVI.<br />
<br />
<i>THE VALIANT CHATTEE-MAKER.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time, in a violent storm of thunder,
lightning, wind and rain, a Tiger crept for shelter
close to the wall of an old woman&rsquo;s hut. This old
woman was very poor, and her hut was but a tumble-down
place, through the roof of which the rain came
drip, drip, drip on more sides than one. This troubled
her much, and she went running about from side to
side, dragging first one thing and then another out of
the way of the leaky places in the roof, and as she did
so she kept saying to herself, &ldquo;Oh dear! oh dear!
how tiresome this is! I&rsquo;m sure the roof will come
down! If an elephant, or a lion, or a tiger were to
walk in, he wouldn&rsquo;t frighten me half so much as this
perpetual dripping.&rdquo; And then she would begin dragging
the bed and all the other things in the room about
again, to get them out of the way of the wet. The
Tiger, who was crouching down just outside, heard all
that she said, and thought to himself, &ldquo;This old woman
says she would not be afraid of an elephant, or a lion,
or a tiger, but that this perpetual dripping frightens her
more than all. What can this &lsquo;perpetual dripping&rsquo;
be?&mdash;it must be something very dreadful.&rdquo; And hearing
her immediately afterward dragging all the things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
about the room again, he said to himself, &ldquo;What a terrible
noise! Surely that must be the &lsquo;<em>perpetual dripping</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment a Chattee-maker,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> who was in
search of his donkey, which had strayed away, came
down the road. The night being very cold, he had,
truth to say, taken a little more toddy than was good
for him, and seeing, by the light of a flash of lightning,
a large animal lying down close to the old woman&rsquo;s
hut, he mistook it for the donkey he was looking for.
So, running up to the Tiger, he seized hold of it by
one ear, and commenced beating, kicking and abusing
it with all his might and main. &ldquo;You wretched creature!&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;is this the way you serve me, obliging
me to come out and look for you in such pouring
rain and on such a dark night as this? Get up instantly,
or I&rsquo;ll break every bone in your body;&rdquo; so he
went on scolding and thumping the Tiger with his
utmost power, for he had worked himself up into a
terrible rage. The Tiger did not know what to make
of it all, but he began to feel quite frightened, and said
to himself, &ldquo;Why, this must be the &lsquo;perpetual dripping;&rsquo;
no wonder the old woman said she was more
afraid of it than of an elephant, a lion, or a tiger, for
it gives most dreadfully hard blows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chattee-maker, having made the Tiger get up,
got on his back and forced him to carry him home,
kicking and beating him the whole way, for all this
time he fancied he was on his donkey; and then he
tied his fore feet and his head firmly together, and fastened
him to a post in front of his house, and when he
had done this he went to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
Next morning, when the Chattee-maker&rsquo;s wife got
up and looked out of the window, what did she see
but a great big Tiger tied up in front of their house, to
the post to which they usually fastened the donkey:
she was very much surprised, and running to her husband,
awoke him, saying, &ldquo;Do you know what animal
you fetched home last night?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, the donkey to
be sure,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Come and see,&rdquo; said she,
and she showed him the great Tiger tied to the post.
The Chattee-maker at this was no less astonished than
his wife, and felt himself all over to find if the Tiger
had not wounded him. But, no! there he was safe
and sound, and there was the Tiger tied to the post,
just as he had fastened it up the night before.</p>

<p>News of the Chattee-maker&rsquo;s exploit soon spread
through the village, and all the people came to see him
and hear him tell how he had caught the Tiger and
tied it to the post; and this they thought so wonderful
that they sent a deputation to the Rajah, with a letter
to tell him how a man of their village had, alone and
unarmed, caught a great Tiger and tied it to a post.</p>

<p>When the Rajah read the letter he also was much
surprised, and determined to go in person and see this
astonishing sight. So he sent for his horses and carriages,
his lords and attendants, and they all set off
together to look at the Chattee-maker and the Tiger he
had caught.</p>

<p>Now the Tiger was a very large one, and had long
been the terror of all the country round, which made
the whole matter still more extraordinary; and all this
being represented to the Rajah, he determined to confer
all possible honor on the valiant Chattee-maker.
So he gave him houses and lands, and as much money
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
as would fill a well, made him a lord of his court, and
conferred on him the command of ten thousand horse.</p>

<p>It came to pass, shortly after this, that a neighboring
Rajah, who had long had a quarrel with this one, sent
to announce his intention of going instantly to war with
him; and tidings were at the same time brought that
the Rajah who sent the challenge had gathered a great
army together on the borders, and was prepared at a
moment&rsquo;s notice to invade the country.</p>

<p>In this dilemma no one knew what to do. The Rajah
sent for all his generals, and inquired of them which
would be willing to take command of his forces and
oppose the enemy. They all replied that the country
was so ill-prepared for the emergency, and the case was
apparently so hopeless, that they would rather not take
the responsibility of the chief command. The Rajah
knew not whom to appoint in their stead. Then some of
his people said to him, &ldquo;You have lately given the command
of ten thousand horse to the valiant Chattee-maker
who caught the Tiger: why not make him
commander-in-chief? A man who could catch a Tiger
and tie him to a post, must surely be more courageous
and clever than most.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Rajah,
&ldquo;I will make him commander-in-chief.&rdquo; So he sent
for the Chattee-maker and said to him, &ldquo;In your hands
I place all the power of the kingdom; you must put
our enemies to flight for us.&rdquo; &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; answered
the Chattee-maker; &ldquo;but, before I lead the whole army
against the enemy, suffer me to go by myself and examine
their position, and, if possible, find out their
numbers and strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah consented, and the Chattee-maker returned
home to his wife, and said: &ldquo;They have made me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
commander-in-chief, which is a very difficult post for
me to fill, because I shall have to ride at the head of
all the army, and you know I never was on a horse in
my life. But I have succeeded in gaining a little delay,
as the Rajah has given me permission to go first alone
and reconnoitre the enemy&rsquo;s camp. Do you therefore
provide a very quiet pony, for you know I cannot ride,
and I will start to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, before the Chattee-maker had started, the Rajah
sent over to him a most magnificent charger richly
caparisoned, which he begged he would ride when
going to see the enemy&rsquo;s camp. The Chattee-maker
was frightened almost out of his life, for the charger
that the Rajah had sent him was very powerful and
spirited, and he felt sure that even if he ever got on it,
he should very soon tumble off; however, he did not
dare to refuse it, for fear of offending the Rajah by not
accepting his present. So he sent back to him a message
of thanks, and said to his wife, &ldquo;I cannot go on
the pony, now that the Rajah has sent me this fine
horse; but how am I ever to ride it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be
frightened,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve only got to get
upon it, and I will tie you firmly on, so that you cannot
tumble off, and if you start at night, no one will see
that you are tied on.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. So that
night his wife brought the horse that the Rajah had sent
him to the door. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the Chattee-maker,
&ldquo;I can never get into that saddle, it is so high up.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You must jump,&rdquo; said his wife. So he tried to jump
several times, but each time he jumped he tumbled down
again. &ldquo;I always forget when I am jumping,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;which way I ought to turn.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your face must
be toward the horse&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;To be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
sure, of course,&rdquo; he cried, and giving one great jump
he jumped into the saddle, but with his face toward the
horse&rsquo;s tail. &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do at all,&rdquo; said his wife as
she helped him down again; &ldquo;try getting on without
jumping.&rdquo; &ldquo;I never can remember,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;when I have got my left foot in the stirrup, what to
do with my right foot or where to put it.&rdquo; &ldquo;That must
go in the other stirrup,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;let me help
you.&rdquo; So, after many trials, in which he tumbled down
very often, for the horse was fresh and did not like
standing still, the Chattee-maker got into the saddle;
but no sooner had he got there than he cried, &ldquo;Oh,
wife, wife! tie me very firmly as quickly as possible,
for I know I shall jump down if I can.&rdquo; Then she
fetched some strong rope and tied his feet firmly into
the stirrups, and fastened one stirrup to the other, and
put another rope round his waist and another round his
neck, and fastened them to the horse&rsquo;s body and neck
and tail.</p>

<p>When the horse felt all these ropes about him he
could not imagine what queer creature had got upon
his back, and he began rearing and kicking and prancing,
and at last set off full gallop, as fast as he could
tear, right across country. &ldquo;Wife, wife!&rdquo; cried the
Chattee-maker, &ldquo;you forgot to tie my hands.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never
mind,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;hold on by the mane.&rdquo; So he
caught hold of the horse&rsquo;s mane as firmly as he could.
Then away went horse, away went Chattee-maker&mdash;away,
away, away, over hedges, over ditches, over
rivers, over plains&mdash;away, away, like a flash of lightning&mdash;now
this way, now that&mdash;on, on, on, gallop,
gallop, gallop&mdash;until they came in sight of the enemy&rsquo;s
camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
The Chattee-maker did not like his ride at all, and
when he saw where it was leading him he liked it still
less, for he thought the enemy would catch him and
very likely kill him. So he determined to make one
desperate effort to be free, and stretching out his hand
as the horse shot past a young banyan tree, seized hold
of it with all his might, hoping that the resistance it
offered might cause the ropes that tied him to break.
But the horse was going at his utmost speed, and the
soil in which the banyan tree grew was loose, so that
when the Chattee-maker caught hold of it and gave it
such a violent pull, it came up by the roots, and on he
rode as fast as before, with the tree in his hand.</p>

<p>All the soldiers in the camp saw him coming, and
having heard that an army was to be sent against them,
made sure that the Chattee-maker was one of the vanguard.
&ldquo;See,&rdquo; cried they, &ldquo;here comes a man of
gigantic stature on a mighty horse! He rides at full
speed across the country, tearing up the very trees in
his rage! He is one of the opposing force; the whole
army must be close at hand. If they are such as he,
we are all dead men.&rdquo; Then, running to their Rajah,
some of them cried again, &ldquo;Here comes the whole
force of the enemy&rdquo; (for the story had by this time
become exaggerated); &ldquo;they are men of gigantic stature,
mounted on mighty horses; as they come they tear
up the very trees in their rage; we can oppose men,
but not monsters such as these.&rdquo; These were followed
by others, who said, &ldquo;It is all true,&rdquo; for by this time
the Chattee-maker had got pretty near the camp;
&ldquo;they&rsquo;re coming! they&rsquo;re coming! let us fly! let us
fly! fly, fly for your lives!&rdquo; And the whole panic-stricken
multitude fled from the camp (those who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
seen no cause for alarm going because the others did,
or because they did not care to stay by themselves),
after having obliged their Rajah to write a letter to the
one whose country he was about to invade to say that
he would not do so, and propose terms of peace, and
to sign it and seal it with his seal. Scarcely had all
the people fled from the camp when the horse on which
the Chattee-maker was came galloping into it, and on
his back rode the Chattee-maker, almost dead from
fatigue, with the banyan tree in his hand: just as he
reached the camp the ropes by which he was tied broke,
and he fell to the ground. The horse stood still, too
tired with his long run to go farther. On recovering
his senses, the Chattee-maker found, to his surprise,
that the whole camp, full of rich arms, clothes and
trappings, was entirely deserted. In the principal tent,
moreover, he found a letter addressed to his Rajah,
announcing the retreat of the invading army and proposing
terms of peace.</p>

<p>So he took the letter, and returned home with it as
fast as he could, leading his horse all the way, for he
was afraid to mount him again. It did not take him
long to reach his house by the direct road, for whilst
riding he had gone a more circuitous journey than was
necessary, and he got there just at nightfall. His wife
ran out to meet him, overjoyed at his speedy return.
As soon as he saw her, he said, &ldquo;Ah, wife, since I saw
you last I&rsquo;ve been all round the world, and had many
wonderful and terrible adventures. But never mind that
now: send this letter quickly to the Rajah by a messenger,
and send the horse also that he sent for me
to ride. He will then see, by the horse looking so
tired, what a long ride I&rsquo;ve had; and if he is sent on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
beforehand, I shall not be obliged to ride him up to the
palace door to-morrow morning, as I otherwise should,
and that would be very tiresome, for most likely I
should tumble off.&rdquo; So his wife sent the horse and the
letter to the Rajah, and a message that her husband
would be at the palace early next morning, as it was
then late at night. And next day he went down there,
as he had said he would; and when the people saw
him coming, they said, &ldquo;This man is as modest as he
is brave; after having put our enemies to flight, he
walks quite simply to the door, instead of riding here
in state, as another man would.&rdquo; For they did not
know that the Chattee-maker walked because he was
afraid to ride.</p>

<p>The Rajah came to the palace door to meet him, and
paid him all possible honor. Terms of peace were
agreed upon between the two countries, and the Chattee-maker
was rewarded for all he had done by being
given twice as much rank and wealth as he had before,
and he lived very happily all the rest of his life.</p>

<br />
<i>THE RAKSHAS&rsquo; PALACE.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there lived a Rajah who was
left a widower with two little daughters. Not
very long after his first wife died he married again, and
his second wife did not care for her step-children, and
was often unkind to them; and the Rajah, their father,
never troubled himself to look after them, but allowed
his wife to treat them as she liked. This made the
poor girls very miserable, and one day one of them
said to the other, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us remain any longer
here; come away into the jungle, for nobody here cares
whether we go or stay.&rdquo; So they both walked off into
the jungle, and lived for many days on the jungle fruits.
At last, after they had wandered on for a long while,
they came to a fine palace which belonged to a Rakshas,
but both the Rakshas and his wife were out when they
got there. Then one of the Princesses said to the
other, &ldquo;This fine palace, in the midst of the jungle, can
belong to no one but a Rakshas, but the owner has
evidently gone out; let us go in and see if we can find
anything to eat.&rdquo; So they went into the Rakshas&rsquo;
house, and finding some rice, boiled and ate it. Then
they swept the room and arranged all the furniture in
the house tidily. But hardly had they finished doing
so when the Rakshas and his wife returned home.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
Then the two Princesses were so frightened that they
ran up to the top of the house and hid themselves on
the flat roof, from whence they could look down on one
side into the inner courtyard of the house, and from
the other could see the open country. The house-top
was a favorite resort of the Rakshas and his wife. Here
they would sit upon the hot summer evenings; here they
winnowed the grain and hung out the clothes to dry;
and the two Princesses found a sufficient shelter behind
some sheaves of corn that were waiting to be threshed.
When the Rakshas came into the house, he looked
round and said to his wife, &ldquo;Somebody has been
arranging the house, everything in it is so clean and
tidy. Wife, did you do this?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know who can have done all this.&rdquo; &ldquo;Some one
also has been sweeping the courtyard,&rdquo; continued the
Rakshas. &ldquo;Wife, did you sweep the courtyard?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I did not do it. I don&rsquo;t know
who did.&rdquo; Then the Rakshas walked round and round
several times with his nose up in the air, saying,
&ldquo;Some one is here now. I smell flesh and blood!
Where can they be?&rdquo; &ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; cried
his wife. &ldquo;You smell blood indeed! Why, you have
just been killing and eating a hundred thousand people.
I should wonder if you didn&rsquo;t still smell flesh
and blood!&rdquo; They went on quarreling thus until
the Rakshas said, &ldquo;Well, never mind; I don&rsquo;t know
how it is, but I&rsquo;m very thirsty; let&rsquo;s come and drink
some water.&rdquo; So both the Rakshas and his wife
went to a well which was close to the house, and
began letting down jars into it, and drawing up the
water and drinking it. And the Princesses, who were
on the top of the house, saw them. Now the youngest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
of the two Princesses was a very wise girl, and when
she saw the Rakshas and his wife by the well, she said
to her sister, &ldquo;I will do something now that will be
good for us both;&rdquo; and, running down quickly from
the top of the house, she crept close behind the Rakshas
and his wife as they stood on tip-toe more than
half over the side of the well, and, catching hold of
one of the Rakshas&rsquo; heels and one of his wife&rsquo;s, gave
each a little push, and down they both tumbled into the
well and were drowned&mdash;the Rakshas and the Rakshas&rsquo;
wife! The Princess then returned to her sister and
said, &ldquo;I have killed the Rakshas.&rdquo; &ldquo;What, both?&rdquo;
cried her sister. &ldquo;Yes, both,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
they come back?&rdquo; said her sister. &ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; answered
she.</p>

<p>The Rakshas being thus killed, the two Princesses
took possession of the house, and lived there very happily
for a long time. In it they found heaps and heaps
of rich clothes and jewels, and gold and silver, which
the Rakshas had taken from people he had murdered;
and all round the house were folds for the flocks and
sheds for the herds of cattle which the Rakshas owned.
Every morning the youngest Princess used to drive out
the flocks and herds to pasturage, and return home
with them every night, while the eldest stayed at home,
cooked the dinner and kept the house; and the youngest
Princess, who was the cleverest, would often say to
her sister, on going away for the day, &ldquo;Take care, if
you see any stranger (be it man, woman or child)
come by the house, to hide, if possible, that nobody
may know of our living here; and if any one should
call out and ask for a drink of water, or any poor
beggar pray for food, before you give it him be sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
you put on ragged clothes and cover your face with
charcoal, and make yourself look as ugly as possible,
lest, seeing how fair you are, he should steal you
away, and we never meet again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; the
other Princess would answer, &ldquo;I will do as you advise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But a long time passed, and no one ever came by
that way. At last one day, after the youngest Princess
had gone out, a young Prince, the son of a neighboring
Rajah, who had been hunting with his attendants for
many days in the jungles, came near the place when
searching for water (for he and his people were tired
with hunting, and had been seeking all through the
jungle for a stream of water, but could find none).
When the Prince saw the fine palace standing all by
itself, he was very much astonished, and said, &ldquo;It is a
strange thing that any one should have built such a
house as this in the depths of the forest. Let us go in;
the owners will doubtless give us a drink of water.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, no, do not go,&rdquo; cried his attendants; &ldquo;this is
most likely the house of a Rakshas.&rdquo; &ldquo;We can but
see,&rdquo; answered the Prince. &ldquo;I should scarcely think
anything very terrible lived here, for there is not a
sound stirring nor a living creature to be seen.&rdquo; So
he began tapping at the door, which was bolted, and
crying, &ldquo;Will whoever owns this house give me and
my people some water to drink, for the sake of kind
charity?&rdquo; But nobody answered, for the Princess,
who heard him, was busy up in her room, blacking her
face with charcoal and covering her rich dress with
rags. Then the Prince got impatient and shook the
door, saying, angrily, &ldquo;Let me in, whoever you are!
If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll force the door open.&rdquo; At this the
poor little Princess got dreadfully frightened; and having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
blacked her face and made herself look as ugly as
possible, she ran down stairs with a pitcher of water,
and unbolting the door, gave the Prince the pitcher to
drink from; but she did not speak, for she was afraid.
Now the Prince was a very clever man, and as he
raised the pitcher to his mouth to drink the water, he
thought to himself, &ldquo;This is a very strange-looking
creature who has brought me this jug of water. She
would be pretty, but that her face seems to want washing,
and her dress also is very untidy. What can that
black stuff be on her face and hands? it looks very unnatural.&rdquo;
And so thinking to himself, instead of
drinking the water, he threw it in the Princess&rsquo; face!
The Princess started back with a little cry, whilst the
water, trickling down her face, washed off the charcoal,
and showed her delicate features and beautiful,
fair complexion. The Prince caught hold of her hand,
and said, &ldquo;Now tell me true, who are you? where do
you come from? Who are your father and mother?
and why are you here alone by yourself in the jungle?
Answer me, or I&rsquo;ll cut your head off.&rdquo; And he made
as if he would draw his sword. The Princess was so
terrified she could hardly speak, but as best she could
she told how she was the daughter of a Rajah, and had
run away into the jungle because of her cruel step-mother,
and, finding the house, had lived there ever
since; and having finished her story, she began to cry.
Then the Prince said to her, &ldquo;Pretty lady, forgive me
for my roughness; do not fear; I will take you home
with me, and you shall be my wife.&rdquo; But the more he
spoke to her the more frightened she got. So frightened
that she did not understand what he said, and
could do nothing but cry. Now she had said nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
to the Prince about her sister, nor even told him that
she had one, for she thought, &ldquo;This man says he will
kill me; if he hears that I have a sister, he will kill
her too.&rdquo; So the Prince, who was really kind-hearted,
and would never have thought of separating the two
little sisters who had been together so long, knew nothing
at all of the matter, and only seeing she was too
much alarmed even to understand gentle words, said
to his servants, &ldquo;Place this lady in one of the palkees,
and let us set off home.&rdquo; And they did so. When
the Princess found herself shut up in the palkee, and
being carried she knew not where, she thought how
terrible it would be for her sister to return home and
find her gone, and determined, if possible, to leave
some sign to show her which way she had been taken.
Round her neck were many strings of pearls. She
untied them, and tearing her saree into little bits, tied
one pearl in each piece of the saree, that it might be
heavy enough to fall straight to the ground; and so
she went on, dropping one pearl and then another and
another and another, all the way she went along, until
they reached the palace where the Rajah and Ranee,
the Prince&rsquo;s father and mother, lived. She threw the
last remaining pearl down just as she reached the
palace gate. The old Rajah and Ranee were delighted
to see the beautiful Princess their son had brought
home; and when they heard her story they said, &ldquo;Ah,
poor thing! what a sad story! but now she has come
to live with us, we will do all we can to make her
happy.&rdquo; And they married her to their son with great
pomp and ceremony, and gave her rich dresses and
jewels, and were very kind to her. But the Princess
remained sad and unhappy, for she was always thinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
about her sister, and yet she could not summon
courage to beg the Prince or his father to send and
fetch her to the palace.</p>

<p>Meantime the youngest Princess, who had been out
with her flocks and herds when the Prince took her
sister away, had returned home. When she came
back she found the door wide open and no one standing
there. She thought it very odd, for her sister always
came every night to the door to meet her on her
return. She went up stairs; her sister was not there;
the whole house was empty and deserted. There she
must stay all alone, for the evening had closed in, and
it was impossible to go outside and seek her with any
hope of success. So all the night long she waited, crying,
&ldquo;Some one has been here, and they have stolen
her away; they have stolen my darling away. O sister!
sister!&rdquo; Next morning, very early, going out to
continue the search, she found one of the pearls belonging
to her sister&rsquo;s necklace tied up in a small piece
of saree; a little farther on lay another, and yet
another, all along the road the Prince had gone.
Then the Princess understood that her sister had left
this clue to guide her on her way, and she at once set
off to find her again. Very, very far she went&mdash;a six
months&rsquo; journey through the jungle, for she could not
travel fast, the many days&rsquo; walking tired her so much&mdash;and
sometimes it took her two or three days to find the
next piece of saree with the pearl. At last she came
near a large town, to which it was evident her sister
had been taken. Now this young Princess was very
beautiful indeed&mdash;as beautiful as she was wise&mdash;and
when she got near the town she thought to herself, &ldquo;If
people see me, they may steal me away, as they did my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
sister, and then I shall never find her again. I will
therefore disguise myself.&rdquo; As she was thus thinking
she saw by the side of the road the corpse of a poor
old beggar woman, who had evidently died from want
and poverty. The body was shriveled up, and nothing
of it remained but the skin and bones. The Princess
took the skin and washed it, and drew it on over her
own lovely face and neck, as one draws a glove on
one&rsquo;s hand. Then she took a long stick and began
hobbling along, leaning on it, toward the town. The
old woman&rsquo;s skin was all crumpled and withered, and
people who passed by only thought, &ldquo;What an ugly
old woman!&rdquo; and never dreamed of the false skin and
the beautiful, handsome girl inside. So on she went,
picking up the pearls&mdash;one here, one there&mdash;until she
found the last pearl just in front of the palace gate.
Then she felt certain her sister must be somewhere
near, but where she did not know. She longed to go
into the palace and ask for her, but no guards would
have let such a wretched-looking old woman enter, and
she did not dare offer them any of the pearls she had
with her, lest they should think she was a thief. So
she determined merely to remain as close to the palace
as possible, and wait till fortune favored her with the
means of learning something further about her sister.
Just opposite the palace was a small house belonging
to a farmer, and the Princess went up to it and stood
by the door. The farmer&rsquo;s wife saw her and said,
&ldquo;Poor old woman, who are you? what do you want?
why are you here? Have you no friends?&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas,
no!&rdquo; answered the Princess. &ldquo;I am a poor old
woman, and have neither father nor mother, son nor
daughter, sister nor brother, to take care of me; all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
are gone, and I can only beg my bread from door to
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not grieve, good mother,&rdquo; answered the farmer&rsquo;s
wife, kindly. &ldquo;You may sleep in the shelter of
our porch, and I will give you some food.&rdquo; So the
Princess stayed there for that night and for many more;
and every day the good farmer&rsquo;s wife gave her food.
But all this time she could learn nothing of her sister.</p>

<p>Now there was a large tank near the palace, on
which grew some fine lotus plants, covered with rich
crimson lotuses&mdash;the royal flower&mdash;and of these the
Rajah was very fond indeed, and prized them very
much. To this tank (because it was the nearest to the
farmer&rsquo;s house) the Princess used to go every morning,
very early, almost before it was light, at about three
o&rsquo;clock, and take off the old woman&rsquo;s skin and wash
it, and hang it out to dry, and wash her face and hands,
and bathe her feet in the cool water, and comb her
beautiful hair. Then she would gather a lotus flower
(such as she had been accustomed to wear in her hair
from a child) and put it on, so as to feel for a few minutes
like herself again! Thus she would amuse herself.
Afterward, as soon as the wind had dried the
old woman&rsquo;s skin, she put it on again, threw away the
lotus flower, and hobbled back to the farmer&rsquo;s door before
the sun was up.</p>

<p>After a time the Rajah discovered that some one had
plucked some of his favorite lotus flowers. People
were set to watch, and all the wise men in the kingdom
put their heads together to try and discover the
thief, but without avail. At last the excitement about
this matter being very great, the Rajah&rsquo;s second son, a
brave and noble young Prince (brother to him who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
had found the eldest Princess in the forest) said, &ldquo;I
will certainly discover this thief.&rdquo; It chanced that
several fine trees grew around the tank. Into one of
these the young Prince climbed one evening (having
made a sort of light thatched roof across two of the
boughs, to keep off the heavy dews), and there he
watched all the night through, but with no more success
than his predecessors. There lay the lotus plants,
still in the moonlight, without so much as a thieving
wind coming by to break off one of the flowers. The
Prince began to get very sleepy, and thought the delinquent,
whoever he might be, could not intend to
return, when, in the very early morning, before it was
light, who should come down to the tank but an old
woman he had often seen near the palace gate.
&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; thought the Prince, &ldquo;this then is the thief;
but what can this queer old woman want with lotus
flowers?&rdquo; Imagine his astonishment when the old
woman sat down on the steps of the tank and began
pulling the skin off her face and arms, and from underneath
the shriveled yellow skin came the loveliest
face he had ever beheld! So fair, so fresh, so young,
so gloriously beautiful, that, appearing thus suddenly,
it dazzled the Prince&rsquo;s eyes like a flash of golden
lightning. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;can this be a woman
or a spirit? a devil or an angel in disguise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Princess twisted up her glossy black hair, and,
plucking a red lotus, placed it in it, and dabbled her
feet in the water, and amused herself by putting round
her neck a string of pearls that had been her sister&rsquo;s
necklace. Then, as the sun was rising, she threw away
the lotus, and covering her face and arms again with
the withered skin, went hastily away. When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
Prince got home, the first thing he said to his parents
was, &ldquo;Father, mother! I should like to marry that
old woman who stands all day at the farmer&rsquo;s gate, just
opposite.&rdquo; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried they, &ldquo;the boy is mad!
Marry that skinny old thing! You cannot&mdash;you are a
King&rsquo;s son. Are there not enough Queens and Princesses
in the world, that you should wish to marry a
wretched old beggar-woman?&rdquo; But he answered,
&ldquo;Above all things I should like to marry that old
woman. You know that I have ever been a dutiful
and obedient son. In this matter, I pray you, grant
me my desire.&rdquo; Then, seeing he was really in earnest
about the matter, and that nothing they could say would
alter his mind, they listened to his urgent entreaties&mdash;not,
however, without much grief and vexation&mdash;and
sent out the guards, who fetched the old woman (who
was really the Princess in disguise) to the palace,
where she was married to the Prince as privately and
with as little ceremony as possible, for the family were
ashamed of the match.</p>

<p>As soon as the wedding was over, the Prince said to
his wife, &ldquo;Gentle wife, tell me how much longer you
intend to wear that old skin? You had better take it
off; do be so kind.&rdquo; The Princess wondered how he
knew of her disguise, or whether it was only a guess
of his; and she thought, &ldquo;If I take this ugly skin off,
my husband will think me pretty, and shut me up in
the palace and never let me go away, so that I shall
not be able to find my sister again. No, I had better
not take it off.&rdquo; So she answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
you mean. I am as all these years have made me;
nobody can change their skin.&rdquo; Then the Prince pretended
to be very angry, and said, &ldquo;Take off that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
hideous disguise this instant, or I&rsquo;ll kill you.&rdquo; But she
only bowed her head, saying, &ldquo;Kill me, then, but nobody
can change their skin.&rdquo; And all this she mumbled
as if she were a very old woman indeed, and had
lost all her teeth and could not speak plain. At this
the Prince laughed very much to himself, and thought,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait and see how long this freak lasts.&rdquo; But the
Princess continued to keep on the old woman&rsquo;s skin;
only every morning, at about three o&rsquo;clock, before it
was light, she would get up and wash it and put it on
again. Then, some time afterward, the Prince, having
found this out, got up softly one morning early, and
followed her to the next room, where she had washed
the skin and placed it on the floor to dry, and stealing
it, he ran away with it and threw it on the fire. So
the Princess, having no old woman&rsquo;s skin to put on,
was obliged to appear in her own likeness. As she
walked forth, very sad at missing her disguise, her husband
ran to meet her, smiling and saying, &ldquo;How do
you do, my dear? Where is your skin now? Can&rsquo;t
you take it off, dear?&rdquo; Soon the whole palace had
heard the joyful news of the beautiful young wife that
the Prince had won; and all the people, when they
saw her, cried, &ldquo;Why she is exactly like the beautiful
Princess our young Rajah married, the jungle lady.&rdquo;
The old Rajah and Ranee were prouder than all of
their daughter-in-law, and took her to introduce her to
their eldest son&rsquo;s wife. Then no sooner did the Princess
enter her sister-in-law&rsquo;s room then she saw that in
her she had found her lost sister, and they ran into each
other&rsquo;s arms. Great then was the joy of all, but the
happiest of all these happy people were the two Princesses.</p>

<h2>XVIII.<br />
<br />
<i>THE BLIND MAN, THE DEAF MAN AND THE
DONKEY.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> BLIND Man and a Deaf Man once entered into
partnership. The Deaf Man was to see for the
Blind Man, and the Blind Man was to hear for the
Deaf Man.</p>

<p>One day both went to a nautch<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> together. The Deaf
Man said, &ldquo;The dancing is very good, but the music is
not worth listening to;&rdquo; and the Blind Man said, &ldquo;On
the contrary, I think the music very good, but the dancing
is not worth looking at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this they went together for a walk in the jungle,
and there they found a Dhobee&rsquo;s donkey that had
strayed away from its owner, and a great big chattee
(such as Dhobees boil clothes in), which the donkey was
carrying with him.</p>

<p>The Deaf Man said to the Blind Man, &ldquo;Brother,
here are a donkey and a Dhobee&rsquo;s great big chattee,
with nobody to own them! Let us take them with us&mdash;they
may be useful to us some day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo;
said the Blind Man, &ldquo;we will take them with us.&rdquo; So
the Blind Man and the Deaf Man went on their way,
taking the donkey and the great big chattee with them.
A little farther on they came to an ant&rsquo;s nest, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
Deaf Man said to the Blind Man, &ldquo;Here are a number
of very fine black ants, much larger than any I ever
saw before. Let us take some of them home to show
our friends.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the Blind Man;
&ldquo;we will take them as a present to our friends.&rdquo; So
the Deaf Man took a silver snuff-box out of his pocket,
and put four or five of the finest black ants into it;
which done, they continued their journey.</p>

<p>But before they had gone very far a terrible storm
came on. It thundered and lightened and rained and
blew with such fury that it seemed as if the whole
heavens and earth were at war. &ldquo;Oh dear! oh dear!&rdquo;
cried the Deaf Man, &ldquo;how dreadful this lightning is!
Let us make haste and get to some place of shelter.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s dreadful at all,&rdquo; answered the
Blind Man, &ldquo;but the thunder is very terrible; we had
better certainly seek some place of shelter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, not far off was a lofty building, which looked
exactly like a fine temple. The Deaf Man saw it, and
he and the Blind Man resolved to spend the night there;
and having reached the place, they went in and shut the
door, taking the donkey and the great big chattee with
them. But this building, which they mistook for a
temple, was in truth no temple at all, but the house of
a very powerful Rakshas; and hardly had the Blind
Man, the Deaf Man and the donkey got inside and
fastened the door than the Rakshas, who had been
out, returned home. To his surprise, he found the
door fastened and heard people moving about inside
his house. &ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; cried he to himself, &ldquo;some
men have got in here, have they! I&rsquo;ll soon make
mince-meat of them.&rdquo; So he began to roar in a voice
louder than the thunder, and he cried, &ldquo;Let me into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
my house this minute, you wretches; let me in, let me
in, I say,&rdquo; and to kick the door and batter it with his
great fists. But though his voice was very powerful,
his appearance was still more alarming, insomuch that
the Deaf Man, who was peeping at him through a
chink in the wall, felt so frightened that he did not
know what to do. But the Blind Man was very brave
(because he couldn&rsquo;t see), and went up to the door and
called out, &ldquo;Who are you? and what do you mean by
coming battering at the door in this way and at this
time of night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Rakshas,&rdquo; answered the Rakshas, angrily,
&ldquo;and this is my house. Let me in this instant, or I&rsquo;ll
kill you.&rdquo; All this time the Deaf Man, who was
watching the Rakshas, was shivering and shaking in
a terrible fright, but the Blind Man was very brave
(because he couldn&rsquo;t see), and he called out again,
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a Rakshas, are you! Well, if you&rsquo;re
Rakshas, I&rsquo;m Bakshas; and Bakshas is as good as
Rakshas.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bakshas!&rdquo; roared the Rakshas. &ldquo;Bakshas!
Bakshas! What nonsense is this? There is no
such creature as a Bakshas!&rdquo; &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; replied
the Blind Man, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t dare to make any further
disturbance, lest I punish you with a vengeance; for
know that I&rsquo;m Bakshas! and Bakshas is Rakshas&rsquo;
father.&rdquo; &ldquo;My father?&rdquo; answered the Rakshas. &ldquo;Heavens
and earth! Bakshas and my father! I never
heard such an extraordinary thing in my life. You
my father; and in there! I never knew my father was
called Bakshas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Blind Man; &ldquo;go away instantly,
I command you, for I am your father Bakshas.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very
well,&rdquo; answered the Rakshas (for he began to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
puzzled and frightened), &ldquo;but if you are my father, let me
first see your face.&rdquo; (For he thought, &ldquo;Perhaps they
are deceiving me.&rdquo;) The Blind Man and the Deaf Man
didn&rsquo;t know what to do; but at last they opened the
door a very tiny chink and poked the donkey&rsquo;s nose
out. When the Rakshas saw it he thought to himself,
&ldquo;Bless me, what a terribly ugly face my father Bakshas
has!&rdquo; He then called out, &ldquo;O father Bakshas, you
have a very big, fierce face; but people have sometimes
very big heads and very little bodies. Pray let me see
your body as well as head before I go away.&rdquo; Then
the Blind Man and the Deaf Man rolled the great, big
Dhobee&rsquo;s chattee with a thundering noise past the chink
in the door, and the Rakshas, who was watching attentively,
was very much surprised when he saw this great
black thing rolling along the floor, and he thought, &ldquo;In
truth, my father Bakshas has a very big body as well
as a big head. He&rsquo;s big enough to eat me up altogether.
I&rsquo;d better go away.&rdquo; But still he could not help being
a little doubtful, so he cried, &ldquo;O Bakshas, father Bakshas!
you have indeed got a very big head and a very
big body; but do, before I go away, let me hear you
scream&rdquo; (for all Rakshas scream fearfully). Then the
cunning Deaf Man (who was getting less frightened)
pulled the silver snuff-box out of his pocket, and took
the black ants out of it, and put one black ant in the
donkey&rsquo;s right ear, and another black ant in the donkey&rsquo;s
left ear, and another and another. The ants pinched
the poor donkey&rsquo;s ears dreadfully, and the donkey was
so hurt and frightened he began to bellow as loud as he
could, &ldquo;Eh augh! eh augh! eh augh! augh! augh!&rdquo;
and at this terrible noise the Rakshas fled away in a great
fright, saying, &ldquo;Enough, enough, father Bakshas! the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
sound of your voice would make the most refractory
obedient.&rdquo; And no sooner had he gone than the Deaf
Man took the ants out of the donkey&rsquo;s ears, and he and
the Blind Man spent the rest of the night in peace and
comfort.</p>

<p>Next morning the Deaf Man woke the Blind Man
early, saying, &ldquo;Awake, brother, awake; here we are
indeed in luck! the whole floor is covered with heaps
of gold and silver and precious stones.&rdquo; And so it was,
for the Rakshas owned a vast amount of treasure, and
the whole house was full of it. &ldquo;That is a good thing,&rdquo;
said the Blind Man. &ldquo;Show me where it is and I will
help you to collect it.&rdquo; So they collected as much treasure
as possible and made four great bundles of it. The
Blind Man took one great bundle, the Deaf Man took
another, and, putting the other two great bundles on
the donkey, they started off to return home. But the
Rakshas, whom they had frightened away the night
before, had not gone very far off, and was waiting to
see what his father Bakshas might look like by daylight.
He saw the door of his house open and watched attentively,
when out walked&mdash;only a Blind Man, a Deaf
Man and a donkey, who were all three laden with
large bundles of his treasure. The Blind Man carried
one bundle, the Deaf Man carried another bundle, and
two bundles were on the donkey.</p>

<p>The Rakshas was extremely angry, and immediately
called six of his friends to help him kill the Blind Man,
the Deaf Man and the donkey, and recover the treasure.</p>

<p>The Deaf Man saw them coming (seven great Rakshas,
with hair a yard long and tusks like an elephant&rsquo;s),
and was dreadfully frightened; but the Blind Man was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
very brave (because he couldn&rsquo;t see), and said, &ldquo;Brother,
why do you lag behind in that way?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
answered the Deaf Man, &ldquo;there are seven great Rakshas
with tusks like an elephant&rsquo;s coming to kill us;
what can we do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Let us hide the treasure in the
bushes,&rdquo; said the Blind Man; &ldquo;and do you lead me to
a tree; then I will climb up first, and you shall climb
up afterward, and so we shall be out of their way.&rdquo;
The Deaf Man thought this good advice; so he pushed
the donkey and the bundles of treasure into the bushes,
and led the Blind Man to a high soparee tree that
grew close by; but he was a very cunning man, this
Deaf Man, and instead of letting the Blind Man climb
up first and following him, he got up first and let the
Blind Man clamber after, so that he was farther out of
harm&rsquo;s way than his friend.</p>

<p>When the Rakshas arrived at the place and saw
them both perched out of reach in the soparee tree, he
said to his friends, &ldquo;Let us get on each other&rsquo;s shoulders;
we shall then be high enough to pull them
down.&rdquo; So one Rakshas stooped down, and the second
got on his shoulders, and the third on his, and the
fourth on his, and the fifth on his, and the sixth on
his; and the seventh and the last Rakshas (who had
invited all the others) was just climbing up when the
Deaf Man (who was looking over the Blind Man&rsquo;s
shoulder) got so frightened that in his alarm he caught
hold of his friend&rsquo;s arm, crying, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming,
they&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo; The Blind Man was not in a very
secure position, and was sitting at his ease, not knowing
how close the Rakshas were. The consequence
was, that when the Deaf Man gave him this unexpected
push, he lost his balance and tumbled down on to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
neck of the seventh Rakshas, who was just then climbing
up. The Blind Man had no idea where he was,
but thought he had got on to the branch of some other
tree; and, stretching out his hand for something to
catch hold of, caught hold of the Rakshas&rsquo; two great
ears, and pinched them very hard in his surprise and
fright. The Rakshas couldn&rsquo;t think what it was that
had come tumbling down upon him; and the weight
of the Blind Man upsetting his balance, down he also
fell to the ground, knocking down in their turn the
sixth, fifth, fourth, third, second and first Rakshas, who
all rolled one over another, and lay in a confused heap
at the foot of the tree together. Meanwhile the Blind
Man called out to his friend, &ldquo;Where am I? what has
happened? Where am I? where am I?&rdquo; The Deaf
Man (who was safe up in the tree) answered, &ldquo;Well
done, brother! never fear! never fear! You&rsquo;re all
right, only hold on tight. I&rsquo;m coming down to help
you.&rdquo; But he had not the least intention of leaving
his place of safety. However, he continued to call
out, &ldquo;Never mind, brother; hold on as tight as you
can. I&rsquo;m coming, I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; and the more he
called out, the harder the Blind Man pinched the Rakshas&rsquo;
ears, which he mistook for some kind of palm
branches. The six other Rakshas, who had succeeded,
after a good deal of kicking, in extricating themselves
from their unpleasant position, thought they had had
quite enough of helping their friend, and ran away as
fast as they could; and the seventh, thinking from their
going that the danger must be greater than he imagined,
and being moreover very much afraid of the
mysterious creature that sat on his shoulders, put his
hands to the back of his ears and pushed off the Blind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
Man, and then (without staying to see who or what
he was) followed his six companions as fast as he
could.</p>

<p>As soon as all the Rakshas were out of sight, the
Deaf Man came down from the tree, and, picking up
the Blind Man, embraced him, saying, &ldquo;I could not
have done better myself. You have frightened away
all our enemies, but you see I came to help you as fast
as possible.&rdquo; He then dragged the donkey and the
bundles of treasure out of the bushes, gave the Blind
Man one bundle to carry, took the second himself, and
put the remaining two on the donkey, as before. This
done, the whole party set off to return home. But
when they had got nearly out of the jungle the Deaf
Man said to the Blind Man, &ldquo;We are now close to the
village, but if we take all this treasure home with us,
we shall run great risk of being robbed. I think our
best plan would be to divide it equally; then you shall
take care of your half, and I will take care of mine,
and each one can hide his share here in the jungle, or
wherever pleases him best.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the
Blind Man; &ldquo;do you divide what we have in the
bundles into two equal portions, keeping one-half yourself
and giving me the other.&rdquo; But the cunning Deaf
Man had no intention of giving up half of the treasure
to the Blind Man; so he first took his own bundle of
treasure and hid it in the bushes, and then he took the
two bundles off the donkey and hid them in the bushes;
and he took a good deal of treasure out of the Blind
Man&rsquo;s bundle, which he also hid. Then, taking the
small quantity that remained, he divided it into two
equal portions, and placing half before the Blind Man
and half in front of himself, said, &ldquo;There, brother, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
your share to do what you please with.&rdquo; The Blind
Man put out his hand, but when he felt what a very
little heap of treasure it was, he got very angry, and
cried, &ldquo;This is not fair&mdash;you are deceiving me; you
have kept almost all the treasure for yourself and only
given me a very little.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, oh! how can you think
so?&rdquo; answered the Deaf Man; &ldquo;but if you will not
believe me, feel for yourself. See, my heap of treasure
is no larger than yours.&rdquo; The Blind Man put out his
hands again to feel how much his friend had kept; but
in front of the Deaf Man lay only a very small heap,
no larger than what he had himself received. At this
he got very cross, and said, &ldquo;Come, come, this won&rsquo;t
do. You think you can cheat me in this way because
I am blind; but I&rsquo;m not so stupid as all that. I carried
a great bundle of treasure, you carried a great bundle
of treasure, and there were two great bundles on the
donkey. Do you mean to pretend that all that made
no more treasure than these two little heaps! No, indeed;
I know better than that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo;
answered the Deaf Man. &ldquo;Stuff or no stuff,&rdquo;
continued the other, &ldquo;you are trying to take me in,
and I won&rsquo;t be taken in by you.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo;
said the Deaf Man. &ldquo;Yes, you are,&rdquo; said the Blind
Man; and so they went on bickering, scolding, growling,
contradicting, until the Blind Man got so enraged
that he gave the Deaf Man a tremendous box on the
ear. The blow was so violent that it made the Deaf
Man hear! The Deaf Man, very angry, gave his
neighbor in return so hard a blow in the face that it
opened the Blind Man&rsquo;s eyes!</p>

<p>So the Deaf Man could hear as well as see! and the
Blind Man could see as well as hear! This astonished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
them both so much that they became good friends at
once. The Deaf Man confessed to having hidden the
bulk of the treasure, which he thereupon dragged forth
from its place of concealment, and, having divided it
equally, they went home and enjoyed themselves.</p>

<i>MUCHIE LAL.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there was a Rajah and Ranee
who had no children. Long had they wished
and prayed that the gods would send them a son, but
it was all in vain&mdash;their prayers were not granted.
One day a number of fish were brought into the royal
kitchen to be cooked for the Rajah&rsquo;s dinner, and
amongst them was one little fish that was not dead, but
all the rest were dead. One of the palace maid-servants
seeing this, took the little fish and put him in a basin
of water. Shortly afterward the Ranee saw him, and
thinking him very pretty, kept him as a pet; and because
she had no children she lavished all her affection
on the fish and loved him as a son; and the people
called him Muchie Rajah (the Fish Prince). In a
little while Muchie Rajah had grown too long to live
in the small basin, so they put him in a larger one, and
then (when he grew too long for that) into a big tub.
In time, however, Muchie Rajah became too large for
even the big tub to hold him; so the Ranee had a tank
made for him in which he lived very happily, and twice
a day she fed him with boiled rice. Now, though the
people fancied Muchie Rajah was only a fish, this was
not the case. He was, in truth, a young Rajah who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
had angered the gods, and been by them turned into a
fish and thrown into the river as a punishment.</p>

<p>One morning, when the Ranee brought him his
daily meal of boiled rice, Muchie Rajah called out to
her and said, &ldquo;Queen Mother, Queen Mother, I am so
lonely here all by myself! Cannot you get me a wife?&rdquo;
The Ranee promised to try, and sent messengers to all
the people she knew, to ask if they would allow one
of their children to marry her son, the Fish Prince.
But they all answered, &ldquo;We cannot give one of our
dear little daughters to be devoured by a great fish,
even though he is the Muchie Rajah and so high in
your Majesty&rsquo;s favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At news of this the Ranee did not know what to do.
She was so foolishly fond of Muchie Rajah, however,
that she resolved to get him a wife at any cost. Again
she sent out messengers, but this time she gave them a
great bag containing a lac of gold mohurs,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and said
to them, &ldquo;Go into every land until you find a wife for
my Muchie Rajah, and to whoever will give you a
child to be the Muchie Ranee<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> you shall give this bag
of gold mohurs.&rdquo; The messengers started on their
search, but for some time they were unsuccessful: not
even the beggars were to be tempted to sell their children,
fearing the great fish would devour them. At last
one day the messengers came to a village where there
lived a Fakeer, who had lost his first wife and married
again. His first wife had had one little daughter, and his
second wife also had a daughter. As it happened, the
Fakeer&rsquo;s second wife hated her little step-daughter,
always gave her the hardest work to do and the least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
food to eat, and tried by every means in her power to
get her out of the way, in order that the child might not
rival her own daughter. When she heard of the errand
on which the messengers had come, she sent for them
when the Fakeer was out, and said to them, &ldquo;Give me
the bag of gold mohurs, and you shall take my little
daughter to marry the Muchie Rajah.&rdquo; (&ldquo;For,&rdquo; she
thought to herself, &ldquo;the great fish will certainly eat the
girl, and she will thus trouble us no more.&rdquo;) Then,
turning to her step-daughter, she said, &ldquo;Go down to
the river and wash your saree, that you may be fit to
go with these people, who will take you to the Ranee&rsquo;s
court.&rdquo; At these words the poor girl went down to
the river very sorrowful, for she saw no hope of escape,
as her father was from home. As she knelt by the
river-side, washing her saree and crying bitterly, some
of her tears fell into the hole of an old Seven-headed
Cobra, who lived on the river-bank. This Cobra was
a very wise animal, and seeing the maiden, he put his
head out of his hole, and said to her, &ldquo;Little girl, why
do you cry?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I am very
unhappy, for my father is from home, and my step-mother
has sold me to the Ranee&rsquo;s people to be the
wife of the Muchie Rajah, that great fish, and I know
he will eat me up.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not be afraid, my daughter,&rdquo;
said the Cobra; &ldquo;but take with you these three stones
and tie them up in the corner of your saree;&rdquo; and so
saying, he gave her three little round pebbles. &ldquo;The
Muchie Rajah, whose wife you are to be, is not really
a fish, but a Rajah who has been enchanted. Your
home will be a little room which the Ranee has had
built in the tank wall. When you are taken there, wait
and be sure you don&rsquo;t go to sleep, or the Muchie Rajah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
will certainly come and eat you up. But as you hear
him coming rushing through the water, be prepared, and
as soon as you see him throw this first stone at him;
he will then sink to the bottom of the tank. The
second time he comes, throw the second stone, when
the same thing will happen. The third time he comes,
throw this third stone, and he will immediately resume
his human shape.&rdquo; So saying, the old Cobra dived
down again into his hole. The Fakeer&rsquo;s daughter took
the stones and determined to do as the Cobra had told
her, though she hardly believed it would have the
desired effect.</p>

<p>When she reached the palace the Ranee spoke kindly
to her, and said to the messengers, &ldquo;You have done
your errand well; this is a dear little girl.&rdquo; Then she
ordered that she should be let down the side of the tank
in a basket to a little room which had been prepared
for her. When the Fakeer&rsquo;s daughter got there, she
thought she had never seen such a pretty place in her
life (for the Ranee had caused the little room to be very
nicely decorated for the wife of her favorite); and she
would have felt very happy away from her cruel step-mother
and all the hard work she had been made to do,
had it not been for the dark water that lay black and
unfathomable below the door, and the fear of the terrible
Muchie Rajah.</p>

<p>After waiting some time she heard a rushing sound,
and little waves came dashing against the threshold;
faster they came and faster, and the noise got louder
and louder, until she saw a great fish&rsquo;s head above the
water&mdash;Muchie Rajah was coming toward her open-mouthed.
The Fakeer&rsquo;s daughter seized one of the
stones that the Cobra had given her and threw it at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
him, and down he sank to the bottom of the tank; a
second time he rose and came toward her, and she
threw the second stone at him, and he again sank
down; a third time he came more fiercely than before,
when, seizing a third stone, she threw it with all her
force. No sooner did it touch him than the spell was
broken, and there, instead of a fish, stood a handsome
young Prince. The poor little Fakeer&rsquo;s daughter was
so startled that she began to cry. But the Prince said
to her, &ldquo;Pretty maiden, do not be frightened. You
have rescued me from a horrible thraldom, and I can
never thank you enough; but if you will be the Muchie
Ranee, we will be married to morrow.&rdquo; Then he sat
down on the door-step, thinking over his strange fate
and watching for the dawn.</p>

<p>Next morning early several inquisitive people came
to see if the Muchie Rajah had eaten up his poor little
wife, as they feared he would; what was their astonishment,
on looking over the tank wall, to see, not the
Muchie Rajah, but a magnificent Prince! The news
soon spread to the palace. Down came the Rajah,
down came the Ranee, down came all their attendants
and dragged Muchie Rajah and the Fakeer&rsquo;s daughter
up the side of the tank in a basket; and when they
heard their story there were great and unparalleled
rejoicings. The Ranee said, &ldquo;So I have indeed found
a son at last!&rdquo; And the people were so delighted, so
happy and so proud of the new Prince and Princess
that they covered all their path with damask from the
tank to the palace, and cried to their fellows, &ldquo;Come
and see our new Prince and Princess. Were ever any
so divinely beautiful? Come see a right royal couple&mdash;a
pair of mortals like the gods!&rdquo; And when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
reached the palace the Prince was married to the
Fakeer&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>There they lived very happily for some time. The
Muchie Ranee&rsquo;s step-mother, hearing what had happened,
came often to see her step-daughter, and pretended
to be delighted at her good fortune; and the Ranee
was so good that she quite forgave all her step-mother&rsquo;s
former cruelty, and always received her very kindly.
At last, one day, the Muchie Ranee said to her husband,
&ldquo;It is a weary while since I saw my father. If you
will give me leave, I should much like to visit my native
village and see him again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;you may go. But do not stay away long; for there
can be no happiness for me till you return.&rdquo; So she
went, and her father was delighted to see her; but her
step-mother, though she pretended to be very kind, was,
in reality, only glad to think she had got the Ranee into
her power, and determined, if possible, never to allow
her to return to the palace again. One day, therefore,
she said to her own daughter, &ldquo;It is hard that your
step-sister should have become Ranee of all the land
instead of being eaten up by the great fish, while we
gained no more than a lac of gold mohurs. Do now
as I bid you, that you may become Ranee in her stead.&rdquo;
She then went on to instruct her how that she must
invite the Ranee down to the river-bank, and there beg
her to let her try on her jewels, and whilst putting them
on give her a push and drown her in the river.</p>

<p>The girl consented, and standing by the river-bank,
said to her step-sister, &ldquo;Sister, may I try on your jewels?&mdash;how
pretty they are!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Ranee, &ldquo;and
we shall be able to see in the river how they look.&rdquo; So,
undoing her necklaces, she clasped them round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
other&rsquo;s neck. But whilst she was doing so her step-sister
gave her a push, and she fell backward into the
water. The girl watched to see that the body did not
rise, and then, running back, said to her mother,
&ldquo;Mother, here are all the jewels, and she will trouble us
no more.&rdquo; But it happened that just when her step-sister
pushed the Ranee into the river her old friend the
Seven-headed Cobra chanced to be swimming across it,
and seeing the little Ranee like to be drowned, he carried
her on his back until he reached his hole, into
which he took her safely. Now this hole, in which the
Cobra and his wife and all his little ones lived, had two
entrances&mdash;the one under the water and leading to the
river, and the other above water, leading out into the
open fields. To this upper end of his hole the Cobra
took the Muchie Ranee, where he and his wife took
care of her; and there she lived with them for some time.
Meanwhile, the wicked Fakeer&rsquo;s wife, having dressed
up her own daughter in all the Ranee&rsquo;s jewels, took
her to the palace, and said to the Muchie Rajah, &ldquo;See,
I have brought your wife, my dear daughter, back safe
and well.&rdquo; The Rajah looked at her, and thought,
&ldquo;This does not look like my wife.&rdquo; However, the
room was dark and the girl was cleverly disguised,
and he thought he might be mistaken. Next day he
said again, &ldquo;My wife must be sadly changed or this
cannot be she, for she was always bright and cheerful.
She had pretty loving ways and merry words, while
this woman never opens her lips.&rdquo; Still, he did not
like to seem to mistrust his wife, and comforted himself
by saying, &ldquo;Perhaps she is tired with the long journey.&rdquo;
On the third day, however, he could bear the uncertainty
no longer, and tearing off her jewels, saw, not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
face of his own little wife, but another woman. Then
he was very angry and turned her out of doors, saying,
&ldquo;Begone; since you are but the wretched tool of others,
I spare your life.&rdquo; But of the Fakeer&rsquo;s wife he said to
his guards, &ldquo;Fetch that woman here instantly; for
unless she can tell me where my wife is, I will have
her hanged.&rdquo; It chanced, however, that the Fakeer&rsquo;s
wife had heard of the Muchie Rajah having turned her
daughter out of doors; so, fearing his anger, she hid
herself, and was not to be found.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Muchie Ranee, not knowing how to
get home, continued to live in the great Seven-headed
Cobra&rsquo;s hole, and he and his wife and all his family
were very kind to her, and loved her as if she had been
one of them; and there her little son was born, and
she called him Muchie Lal,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> after the Muchie Rajah,
his father. Muchie Lal was a lovely child, merry and
brave, and his playmates all day long were the young
Cobras.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> When he was about three years old a bangle-seller
came by that way, and the Muchie Ranee
bought some bangles from him and put them on her
boy&rsquo;s wrists and ankles; but by next day, in playing,
he had broken them all. Then, seeing the bangle-seller,
the Ranee called him again and bought some
more, and so on every day until the bangle-seller got
quite rich from selling so many bangles for the Muchie
Lal, for the Cobra&rsquo;s hole was full of treasure, and he
gave the Muchie Ranee as much money to spend every
day as she liked. There was nothing she wished for
he did not give her, only he would not let her try to
get home to her husband, which she wished more than
all. When she asked him he would say, &ldquo;No, I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
not let you go. If your husband comes here and
fetches you, it is well; but I will not allow you to
wander in search of him through the land alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so she was obliged to stay where she was.</p>

<p>All this time the poor Muchie Rajah was hunting in
every part of the country for his wife, but he could
learn no tidings of her. For grief and sorrow at losing
her he had gone well-nigh distracted, and did nothing
but wander from place to place, crying, &ldquo;She is gone!
she is gone!&rdquo; Then, when he had long inquired without
avail of all the people in her native village about
her, he one day met a bangle-seller and said to him,
&ldquo;Whence do you come?&rdquo; The bangle-seller answered,
&ldquo;I have just been selling bangles to some people who
live in a Cobra&rsquo;s hole in the river-bank.&rdquo; &ldquo;People!
What people?&rdquo; asked the Rajah. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered
the bangle-seller, &ldquo;a woman and a child: the child is
the most beautiful I ever saw. He is about three years
old, and of course, running about, is always breaking
his bangles, and his mother buys him new ones every
day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you know what the child&rsquo;s name is?&rdquo; said
the Rajah. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the bangle-seller, carelessly,
&ldquo;for the lady always calls him her Muchie Lal.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; thought the Muchie Rajah, &ldquo;this must be my
wife.&rdquo; Then he said to him again, &ldquo;Good bangle-seller,
I would see these strange people of whom you
speak; cannot you take me there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo;
replied the bangle-seller; &ldquo;daylight has gone, and we
should only frighten them; but I shall be going there
again to-morrow, and then you may come too. Meanwhile,
come and rest at my house for the night, for you
look faint and weary.&rdquo; The Rajah consented. Next
morning, however, very early, he woke the bangle-seller,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
saying, &ldquo;Pray let us go now and see the people
you spoke about yesterday.&rdquo; &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said the bangle-seller;
&ldquo;it is much too early. I never go till after
breakfast.&rdquo; So the Rajah had to wait till the bangle-seller
was ready to go. At last they started off, and
when they reached the Cobra&rsquo;s hole the first thing the
Rajah saw was a fine little boy playing with the young
Cobras.</p>

<p>As the bangle-seller came along, jingling his bangles,
a gentle voice from inside the hole called out, &ldquo;Come
here, my Muchie Lal, and try on your bangles.&rdquo; Then
the Muchie Rajah, kneeling down at the mouth of the
hole, said, &ldquo;Oh, lady, show your beautiful face to me.&rdquo;
At the sound of his voice the Ranee ran out, crying,
&ldquo;Husband, husband! have you found me again.&rdquo;
And she told him how her sister had tried to drown
her, and how the good Cobra had saved her life and
taken care of her and her child. Then he said, &ldquo;And
will you now come home with me?&rdquo; And she told
him how the Cobra would never let her go, and said,
&ldquo;I will first tell him of your coming; for he has been
as a father to me.&rdquo; So she called out, &ldquo;Father Cobra,
father Cobra, my husband has come to fetch me; will
you let me go?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if your husband
has come to fetch you, you may go.&rdquo; And his wife
said, &ldquo;Farewell, dear lady, we are loth to lose you,
for we have loved you as a daughter.&rdquo; And all the
little Cobras were very sorrowful to think that they
must lose their playfellow, the young Prince. Then
the Cobra gave the Muchie Rajah and the Muchie
Ranee and Muchie Lal all the most costly gifts he
could find in his treasure-house; and so they went
home, where they lived very happy ever after.</p>

<i>CHUNDUN RAJAH.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time, a Rajah and Ranee died,
leaving seven sons and one daughter. All these
seven sons were married, and the wives of the six eldest
used to be very unkind to their poor little sister-in-law;
but the wife of the seventh brother loved her dearly,
and always took her part against the others. She would
say, &ldquo;Poor little thing! her life is sad. Her mother
wished so long for a daughter, and then the girl was
born and the mother died, and never saw her poor
child, or was able to ask any one to take care of her.&rdquo;
At which the wives of the six elder brothers would answer,
&ldquo;You only take such notice of the girl in order
to vex us.&rdquo; Then, while their husbands were away,
they made up wicked stories against their sister-in-law,
which they told them on their return home; and their
husbands believed them rather than her, and were very
angry with her and ordered her to be turned out of the
house. But the wife of the seventh brother did not
believe what the six others said, and was very kind to
the little Princess, and sent her secretly as much food
as she could spare from her own dinner. But as they
drove her from their door, the six wives of the elder
brothers cried out, &ldquo;Go away, wicked girl, go away,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
and never let us see your face again until you marry
Chundun Rajah!<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> When you invite us to the wedding,
and give us, the six eldest, six common wooden stools
to sit on, but the seventh sister (who always takes your
part) a fine emerald chair, we will believe you innocent
of all the evil deeds of which you are accused, but not till
then!&rdquo; This they said scornfully, railing at her; for
Chundun Rajah, of whom they spoke (who was the
great Rajah of a neighboring country), had been dead
many months.</p>

<p>So, sad at heart, the Princess wandered forth into the
jungle; and when she had gone through it, she came
upon another, still denser than the first. The trees
grew so thickly overhead that she could scarcely see
the sky, and there was no village or house of living
creature near. The food her youngest sister-in-law had
given her was nearly exhausted, and she did not know
where to get more. At last, however, after journeying
on for many days, she came upon a large tank, beside
which was a fine house that belonged to a Rakshas.
Being very tired, she sat down on the edge of the tank
to eat some of the parched rice that remained of her
store of provisions; and as she did so she thought,
&ldquo;This house belongs doubtless to a Rakshas, who perhaps
will see me and kill and eat me; but since no one
cares for me, and I have neither home nor friends, I
hold life cheap enough.&rdquo; It happened, however, that
the Rakshas was then out, and there was no one in his
house but a little cat and dog, who were his servants.</p>

<p>The dog&rsquo;s duty was to take care of the saffron with
which the Rakshas colored his face on highdays and
holidays, and the cat had charge of the antimony with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
which he blackened his eyelids. Before the Princess
had been long by the tank, the little cat spied her out,
and running to her, said, &ldquo;Oh, sister, sister, I am so
hungry, pray give me some of your dinner.&rdquo; The
Princess answered, &ldquo;I have very little rice left; when
it is all gone I shall starve. If I give you some, what
have you to give me in exchange?&rdquo; The cat said, &ldquo;I
have charge of the antimony with which my Rakshas
blackens his eyelids&mdash;I will give you some of it;&rdquo; and
running to the house she fetched a nice little potful of
antimony, which she gave to the Princess in exchange
for the rice. When the little dog saw this, he also ran
down to the tank, and said, &ldquo;Lady, lady, give me some
rice, I pray you, for I, too, am very hungry.&rdquo; But she
answered, &ldquo;I have very little rice left, and when it is
all gone I shall starve. If I give you some of my dinner,
what will you give me in exchange?&rdquo; The dog
said, &ldquo;I have charge of my Rakshas&rsquo; saffron, with
which he colors his face. I will give you some of it.&rdquo;
So he ran to the house and fetched a quantity of saffron
and gave it to the Princess, and she gave him also some
of the rice. Then, tying the antimony and saffron up
in her saree, she said good-bye to the dog and cat and
went on her way.</p>

<p>Three or four days after this, she found she had
nearly reached the other side of the jungle. The wood
was not so thick, and in the distance she saw a large
building that looked like a great tomb. The Princess
determined to go and see what it was, and whether she
could find any one there to give her any food, for she
had eaten all the rice and felt very hungry, and it was
getting toward night.</p>

<p>Now the place toward which the Princess went was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
the tomb of the Chundun Rajah, but this she did not
know.</p>

<p>Chundun Rajah had died many months before, and
his father and mother and sisters, who loved him very
dearly, could not bear the idea of his being buried
under the cold ground; so they had built a beautiful
tomb, and inside it they had placed the body on a bed
under a canopy, and it had never decayed, but continued
as fair and perfect as when first put there.
Every day Chundun Rajah&rsquo;s mother and sister would
come to the place to weep and lament from sunrise to
sunset, but each evening they returned to their own
homes. Hard by was a shrine and small hut where a
Brahmin lived, who had charge of the place; and from
far and near people used to come to visit the tomb of
their lost Rajah and see the great miracle, how the
body of him who had been dead so many months
remained perfect and undecayed; but none knew why
this was. When the Princess got near the place a
violent storm came on. The rain beat upon her and
wetted her, and it grew so dark she could hardly see
where she was going. She would have been afraid to
go into the tomb had she known about Chundun
Rajah; but as it was, the storm being so violent and
night approaching, she ran in there for shelter as fast
as she could, and sat down shivering in one corner. By
the light of an oil lamp that burnt dimly in a niche in
the wall, she saw in front of her the body of the Rajah
lying under the canopy, with the heavy jeweled coverlid
over him and the rich hangings all round. He
looked as if he were only asleep, and she did not feel
frightened. But at twelve o&rsquo;clock, to her great surprise,
as she was watching and waiting, the Rajah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
came to life; and when he saw her sitting shivering in
the corner, he fetched a light and came toward her and
said, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I am a poor
lonely girl. I only came here for shelter from the storm.
I am dying of cold and hunger.&rdquo; And then she told
him all her story&mdash;how that her sisters-in-law had
falsely accused her, and driven her from among them
into the jungle, bidding her see their faces no more
until she married the Chundun Rajah, who had been
dead so many months; and how the youngest had been
kind to her and sent her food, which had prevented
her from starving by the way.</p>

<p>The Rajah listened to the Princess&rsquo; words, and was
certain that they were true and she no common beggar
from the jungles. For, for all her ragged clothes, she
looked a royal lady, and shone like a star in the darkness.
Moreover, her eyelids were darkened with antimony
and her beautiful face painted with saffron, like
the face of a Princess. Then he felt a great pity for
her, and said, &ldquo;Lady, have no fear, for I will take
care of you,&rdquo; and dragging the rich coverlid off his bed
he threw it over her to keep her warm, and going to
the Brahmin&rsquo;s house, which was close by, fetched some
rice, which he gave her to eat. Then he said, &ldquo;I am
the Chundun Rajah, of whom you have heard. I die
every day, but every night I come to life for a little
while.&rdquo; She cried, &ldquo;Do none of your family know of
this? and if so, why do you stay here in a dismal
tomb?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;None know it but the Brahmin
who has charge of this place. Since my life is
thus maimed, what would it avail to tell my family?
It would but grieve them more than to think me dead.
Therefore, I have forbidden him to let them know;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
and since my parents only come here by day, they have
never found it out. Maybe I shall some time wholly
recover, and till then I will be silent about my existence.&rdquo;
Then he called the Brahmin who had charge
of the tomb and the shrine (and who daily placed an
offering of food upon it for the Rajah to eat when he
came to life), and said to him, &ldquo;Henceforth, place a
double quantity of food upon the shrine, and take care
of this lady. If I ever recover she shall be my Ranee.&rdquo;
And having said these words he died again. Then the
Brahmin took the Princess to his little hut, and bade
his wife see that she wanted for nothing, and all the
next day she rested in that place. Very early in the
morning Chundun Rajah&rsquo;s mother and sisters came to
visit the tomb, but they did not see the Princess; and
in the evening, when the sun was setting, they went
away. That night, when the Chundun Rajah came to
life, he called the Brahmin, and said to him, &ldquo;Is the
Princess still here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;for she
is weary with her journey, and she has no home to go
to.&rdquo; The Rajah said, &ldquo;Since she has neither home
nor friends, if she be willing, you shall marry me to
her, and she shall wander no further in search of
shelter.&rdquo; So the Brahmin fetched his shastra<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and
called all his family as witnesses, and married the
Rajah to the little Princess, reading prayers over them
and scattering rice and flowers upon their heads. And
there the Chundun Ranee lived for some time. She
was very happy; she wanted nothing, and the Brahmin
and his wife took as much care of her as if she had
been their daughter. Every day she would wait outside
the tomb, but at sunset she always returned to it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
and watched for her husband to come to life. One
night she said to him, &ldquo;Husband, I am happier to be
your wife, and hold your hand and talk to you for two
or three hours every evening, than were I married to
some great living Rajah for a hundred years. But oh
what joy it would be if you could come wholly to life
again! Do you know what is the cause of your daily
death? and what it is that brings you to life each night
at twelve o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is because I have lost my Chundun
Har,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the sacred necklace that held my soul. A
Peri stole it. I was in the palace garden one day,
when many of those winged ladies flew over my head,
and one of them, when she saw me, loved me and
asked me to marry her. But I said no, I would not;
and at that she was angry, and tore the Chundun Har
off my neck and flew away with it. That instant I fell
down dead, and my father and mother caused me to
be placed in this tomb; but every night the Peri comes
here and takes my necklace off her neck, and when she
takes it off I come to life again, and she asks me to
come away with her and marry her, and she does not
put on the necklace again for two or three hours, waiting
to see if I will consent. During that time I live.
But when she finds I will not, she puts on the necklace
again and flies away, and as soon as she puts it on, I
die.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Cannot the Peri be caught?&rdquo; asked the Chundun
Ranee. Her husband answered, &ldquo;No, I have
often tried to seize back my necklace, for if I could regain
it I should come wholly to life again; but the
Peri can at will render herself invisible and fly away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
with it, so that it is impossible for any mortal man to
get it.&rdquo; At this news the Chundun Ranee was sad at
heart, for she saw no hope of the Rajah&rsquo;s being restored
to life; and grieving over this she became so ill and
unhappy that even when she had a little baby boy
born, it did not much cheer her, for she did nothing
but think, &ldquo;This poor child will grow up in this desolate
place, and have no kind father day by day to teach
him and help him as other children have, but only see
him for a little while by night; and we are all at the
mercy of the Peri, who may any day fly quite away
with the necklace and not return.&rdquo; The Brahmin,
seeing how ill she was, said to the Chundun Rajah,
&ldquo;The Ranee will die unless she can be somewhere
where much care will be taken of her, for in my poor
home my wife and I can do but little for her comfort.
Your mother and sister are good and charitable; let
her go to the palace, where they will only need to see
she is ill to take care of her.&rdquo; Now it happened that
in the palace courtyard there was a great slab of white
marble, on which the Chundun Rajah would often
rest on the hot summer days; and because he used to
be so fond of it, when he died his father and mother
ordered that it should be taken great care of, and no
one was allowed to so much as touch it. Knowing
this, Chundun Rajah said to his wife, &ldquo;You are ill; I
should like you to go to the palace, where my mother
and sisters will take the greatest care of you. Do this,
therefore: take our child and sit down with him upon
the great slab of marble in the palace courtyard. I
used to be very fond of it; and so now for my sake it
is kept with the greatest care, and no one is allowed
to so much as touch it. They will most likely see you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
there and order you to go away; but if you then tell
them you are ill, they will, I know, have pity on you
and befriend you.&rdquo; The Chundun Ranee did as her
husband told her, placing her little boy on the great
slab of white marble in the palace courtyard and sitting
down herself beside him. Chundun Rajah&rsquo;s sister,
who was looking out of the window, saw her and cried,
&ldquo;Mother, there are a woman and her child resting on
my brother&rsquo;s marble slab; let us tell them to go away.&rdquo;
So she ran down to the place, but when she saw Chundun
Ranee and the little boy she was quite astonished,
the Chundun Ranee was so fair and lovable-looking,
and the baby was the image of her dead brother. Then
returning to her mother, she said, &ldquo;Mother, she who
sits upon the marble stone is the prettiest little lady I
ever saw; and do not let us blame the poor thing; she
says she is ill and weary, and the baby (I know not if
it is fancy, or the seeing him on that stone) seems to
me the image of my lost brother.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">CHUNDUN RANEE.&mdash;p. <a href="#Page_276">276</a>.</p>

<p>At this the old Ranee and the rest of the family went
out, and when they saw the Chundun Ranee, they all
took such a fancy to her and to the child that they
brought her into the palace, and were very kind to her,
and took great care of her; so that in a while she got
well and strong again, and much less unhappy; and
they all made a great pet of the little boy, for they were
struck with his strange likeness to the dead Rajah; and
after a time they gave his mother a small house to live
in, close to the palace, where they often used to go and
visit her. There also the Chundun Rajah would go
each night when he came to life, to laugh and talk with
his wife and play with his boy, although he still refused
to tell his father and mother of his existence. One day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
it happened, however, that the little child told one of
the Princesses (Chundun Rajah&rsquo;s sister) how every evening
some one who came to the house used to laugh and
talk with his mother and play with him, and then go
away. The Princess also heard the sound of voices in
Chundun Ranee&rsquo;s house, and saw lights flickering about
there when they were supposed to be fast asleep. Of
this she told her mother, saying, &ldquo;Let us go down to-morrow
night and see what this means; perhaps the
woman we thought so poor and befriended thus is
nothing but a cheat, and entertains all her friends every
night at our expense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the next evening they went down softly, softly to
the place, when they saw, not the strangers they had
expected, but their long-lost Chundun Rajah. Then,
since he could not escape, he told them all&mdash;how that
every night for an hour or two he came to life, but was
dead all day. And they rejoiced greatly to see him
again, and reproached him for not letting them know
he ever lived, though for so short a time. He then told
them how he had married the Chundun Ranee, and
thanked them for all their loving care of her.</p>

<p>After this he used to come every night and sit and
talk with them; but still each day, to their great sorrow,
he died; nor could they divine any means for getting
back his Chundun Har, which the Peri wore round her
neck.</p>

<p>At last one evening, when they were all laughing
and chatting together, seven Peris flew into the room
unobserved by them, and one of the seven was the very
Peri who had stolen Chundun Rajah&rsquo;s necklace, and
she held it in her hand.</p>

<p>All the young Peris were very fond of the Chundun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
Rajah and Chundun Ranee&rsquo;s boy, and used often to
come and play with him, for he was the image of his
father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s loveliness, and as fair as the morning;
and he used to laugh and clap his little hands
when he saw them coming; for though men and women
cannot see Peris, little children can.</p>

<p>Chundun Rajah was tossing the child up in the air
when the Peris flew into the room, and the little boy
was laughing merrily. The winged ladies fluttered
round the Rajah and the child, and she that had the
necklace hovered over his head. Then the boy, seeing
the glittering necklace which the Peri held, stretched
out his little arms and caught hold of it, and as he seized
it the string broke, and all the beads fell upon the floor.
At this the seven Peris were frightened and flew away,
and the Chundun Ranee, collecting the beads, strung
them and hung them round the Rajah&rsquo;s neck; and there
was great joy amongst those that loved him, because he
had recovered the sacred necklace, and that the spell
which doomed him to death was broken.</p>

<p>The glad news was soon known throughout the kingdom,
and all the people were happy and proud to hear
it, crying, &ldquo;We have lost our young Rajah for such a
long, long time, and now one little child has brought
him back to life.&rdquo; And the old Rajah and Ranee
(Chundun Rajah&rsquo;s father and mother) determined that
he should be married again to the Chundun Ranee with
great pomp and splendor, and they sent letters into all
the kingdoms of the world, saying, &ldquo;Our son the Chundun
Rajah has come to life again, and we pray you
come to his wedding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, among those who accepted the invitation, were
the Chundun Ranee&rsquo;s seven brothers and their seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
wives; and for her six sisters-in-law, who had been so
cruel to her and caused her to be driven out into the
jungle, the Chundun Ranee prepared six common
wooden stools; but for the seventh, who had been kind
to her, she made ready an emerald throne and a foot-stool
adorned with emeralds.</p>

<p>When all the Ranees were taken to their places, the
six eldest complained, saying, &ldquo;How is this? Six of
us are given only common wooden stools to sit upon,
but the seventh has an emerald chair?&rdquo; Then the Chundun
Ranee stood up, and before the assembled guests
told them her story, reminding her six elder sisters-in-law
of their former taunts, and how they had forbidden
her to see them again until the day of her marriage
with the Chundun Rajah, and she explained how unjustly
they had accused her to her brothers. When the
Ranees heard this they were struck dumb with fear and
shame, and were unable to answer a word; and all
their husbands, being much enraged to learn how they
had conspired to kill their sister-in-law, commanded
that these wicked woman should be instantly hanged,
which was accordingly done. Then, on the same day
that the Chundun Rajah remarried their sister, the six
elder brothers were married to six beautiful ladies of
the court amid great and unheard-of rejoicings, and
from that day they all lived together in perfect peace
and harmony until their lives&rsquo; end.</p>

<i>SODEWA BAI.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there lived a Rajah and Ranee,
who had only one daughter, and she was the
most beautiful Princess in the world. Her face was as
fair and delicate as the clear moonlight, and they called
her Sodewa Bai.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> At her birth her father and mother
had sent for all the wise men in the kingdom to tell her
fortune, and they predicted that she would grow up
richer and more fortunate than any other lady; and so
it was, for from her earliest youth she was good and
lovely, and whenever she opened her lips to speak
pearls and precious stones fell upon the ground, and as
she walked along they would scatter on either side of
her path, insomuch that her father soon became the
richest Rajah in all that country, for his daughter could
not go across the room without shaking down jewels
worth a dowry. Moreover, Sodewa Bai was born
with a golden necklace about her neck, concerning
which also her parents consulted astrologers, who said,
&ldquo;This is no common child; the necklace of gold about
her neck contains your daughter&rsquo;s soul: let it therefore
be guarded with the utmost care, for if it were taken
off and worn by another person she would die.&rdquo; So
the Ranee, her mother, caused it to be firmly fastened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
round the child&rsquo;s neck, and as soon as she was old
enough to understand, instructed her concerning its
value, and bade her on no account ever to allow it to
be taken off.</p>

<p>At the time my story begins this Princess was fourteen
years old, but she was not married, for her father
and mother had promised that she should not do so
until it pleased herself; and although many great
rajahs and nobles sought her hand, she constantly
refused them all.</p>

<p>Now Sodewa Bai&rsquo;s father, on one of her birth-days,
gave her a lovely pair of slippers made of gold and
jewels. Each slipper was worth a hundred thousand
gold mohurs. There were none like them in all the
earth. Sodewa Bai prized these slippers very much,
and always wore them when she went out walking, to
protect her tender feet from the stones; but one day, as
she was wandering with her ladies upon the side of the
mountain on which the palace was built, playing and
picking the wild flowers, her foot slipped and one of the
golden slippers fell down, down, down the steep hill-slope,
over rocks and stones, into the jungle below.
Sodewa Bai sent attendants to search for it, and the
Rajah caused criers to go throughout the town and
proclaim that whoever discovered the Princess&rsquo; slipper
should receive a great reward; but though it was
hunted for far and near, high and low, it could not be
found.</p>

<p>It chanced, however, that not very long after this a
young Prince, the eldest son of a Rajah who lived in
the plains, was out hunting, and in the jungle he picked
up the very little golden slipper which Sodewa Bai had
lost, and which had tumbled all the way from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
mountain-side into the depths of the forest. He took
it home with him, and showed it to his mother, saying,
&ldquo;What a fairy foot must have worn this tiny slipper!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah, my boy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this must have belonged to
a lovely Princess, in truth (if she is but as beautiful as
her slipper); would that you could find such a one to
be your wife!&rdquo; Then they sent into all the towns
of the kingdom to inquire for the owner of the lost
slipper, but she could not be found. At last, when
many months had gone by, it happened that news was
brought by travelers to the Rajah&rsquo;s capital, of how, in
a far distant land, very high among the mountains,
there lived a beautiful Princess who had lost her slipper,
and whose father had offered a great reward to
whoever should restore it; and from the description
they gave all were assured it was the one that the
Prince had found.</p>

<p>Then his mother said to him, &ldquo;My son, it is certain
that the slipper you found belongs to none other than
the great Mountain Rajah&rsquo;s daughter; therefore take it
to his palace, and when he offers you the promised
reward, say that you wish for neither silver nor gold,
but ask him to give you his daughter in marriage.
Thus you may gain her for your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince did as his mother advised; and when,
after a long, long journey, he reached the court of
Sodewa Bai&rsquo;s father, he presented the slipper to him,
saying, &ldquo;I have found your daughter&rsquo;s slipper, and for
restoring it I claim a great reward.&rdquo; &ldquo;What will you
have?&rdquo; said the Rajah. &ldquo;Shall I pay you in horses? or
in silver? or in gold?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the Prince, &ldquo;I
will have none of these things. I am the son of a
Rajah who lives in the plains, and I found this slipper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
in the jungle where I was hunting, and have traveled
for many weary days to bring it you; but the only payment
I care for is the hand of your beautiful daughter;
if it pleases you, let me become your son-in-law.&rdquo; The
Rajah replied, &ldquo;This only I cannot promise you; for
I have vowed I will not oblige my daughter to marry
against her will. This matter depends upon her alone.
If she is willing to be your wife, I also am willing;
but it rests with her free choice.&rdquo; Now it happened that
Sodewa Bai had from her window seen the Prince
coming up to the palace gate, and when she heard his
errand, she said to her father, &ldquo;I saw that Prince, and
I am willing to marry him.&rdquo; So they were married
with great pomp and splendor. When all the other
Rajah&rsquo;s, Sodewa Bai&rsquo;s suitors, heard of this, they were,
however much astonished as well as vexed, and said,
&ldquo;What can have made Sodewa Bai take a fancy to that
young Prince? He is not so wonderfully handsome,
and he is very poor. This is a most foolish marriage.&rdquo;
But they all came to it, and were entertained at the
palace, where the wedding festivities lasted many days.
After Sodewa Bai and her husband had lived there
for some little time, he one day said to his father-in-law,
&ldquo;I have a great desire to see my own people again and
to return to my own country. Let me take my wife
home with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah said, &ldquo;Very well. I am willing that
you should go. Take care of your wife; guard her as
the apple of your eye; and be sure you never permit
the golden necklace to be taken from her neck and
given to any one else, for in that case she would die.&rdquo;
The Prince promised, and he returned with Sodewa
Bai to his father&rsquo;s kingdom. At their departure the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
Rajah of the Mountain gave them many elephants,
horses, camels and attendants, besides jewels innumerable
and much money, and many rich hangings,
robes and carpets. The old Rajah and Ranee of the
Plain were delighted to welcome home their son and
his beautiful bride; and there they might all have lived
their lives long in uninterrupted peace and happiness,
had it not been for one unfortunate circumstance.
Rowjee (for that was the Prince&rsquo;s name) had another
wife, to whom he had been married when a child, long
before he had found Sodewa Bai&rsquo;s golden slipper; she
therefore was the first Ranee, though Sodewa Bai was
the one he loved the best (for the first Ranee was of a
sullen, morose and jealous disposition.) His father
also, and his mother, preferred Sodewa Bai to their
other daughter-in-law. The first Ranee could not bear
to think of any one being Ranee beside herself; and
more especially of another not only in the same position,
but better loved by all around than she; and
therefore in her wicked heart she hated Sodewa Bai
and longed for her destruction, though outwardly she
pretended to be very fond of her. The old Rajah and
Ranee, knowing of the first Ranee&rsquo;s jealous and envious
disposition, never liked Sodewa Bai to be much
with her; but as they had only a vague fear, and no
certain ground for alarm, they could do no more than
watch both carefully; and Sodewa Bai, who was
guileless and unsuspicious, would remonstrate with
them when they warned her not to be so intimate with
Rowjee Rajah&rsquo;s other wife, saying, &ldquo;I have no fear.
I think she loves me as I love her. Why should we
disagree? Are we not sisters?&rdquo; One day, Rowjee
Rajah was obliged to go on a journey to a distant part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
of his father&rsquo;s kingdom, and, being unable to take
Sodewa Bai with him, he left her in his parents&rsquo; charge,
promising to return soon, and begging them to watch
over her, and to go every morning and see that she was
well; which they agreed to do.</p>

<p>A little while after their husband had gone, the first
Ranee went to Sodewa Bai&rsquo;s room and said to her,
&ldquo;It is lonely for us both, now Rowjee is away; but
you must come often to see me, and I will come often
to see you and talk to you, and so we will amuse ourselves
as well as we can.&rdquo; To this Sodewa Bai agreed,
and to amuse the first Ranee she took out all her jewels
and pretty things to show her. As they were looking
over them, the first Ranee said, &ldquo;I notice you always
wear that row of golden beads round your neck. Why
do you? Have you any reason for always wearing the
same ones?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered Sodewa Bai,
thoughtlessly. &ldquo;I was born with these beads round
my neck, and the wise men told my father and mother
that they contain my soul, and that if any one else wore
them I should die. Therefore I always wear them. I
have never once taken them off.&rdquo; When the first
Ranee heard this news she was very much pleased;
yet she feared to steal the beads herself, both because
she was afraid she might be found out, and because she
did not like with her own hands to commit the crime.
So, returning to her house, she called her most confidential
servant, a negress, whom she knew to be
trustworthy, and said to her, &ldquo;Go this evening to
Sodewa Bai&rsquo;s room when she is asleep, and take from
her neck the string of golden beads, and fasten them
round your own neck, and return to me. Those beads
contain her soul, and as soon as you put them on she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
will cease to live.&rdquo; The negress agreed to do as she
was told; for she had long known that her mistress
hated Sodewa Bai and desired nothing so much as her
death. So that night, going softly into the sleeping
Ranee&rsquo;s room, she stole the golden necklace, and fastening
it round her own neck, crept away without any
one knowing what was done; and when the negress
put on the necklace, Sodewa Bai&rsquo;s spirit fled.</p>

<p>Next morning the old Rajah and Ranee went as
usual to see their daughter-in-law, and knocked at the
door of her room. No one answered. They knocked
again and again; still no reply. They then went in,
and found her lying there, cold as marble and quite
dead, though she seemed very well when they had seen
her before. They asked her attendants, who slept just
outside her door, whether she had been ill that night,
or if any one had gone into her room? But they declared
they had heard no sound, and were sure no one
had been near the place. In vain the Rajah and
Ranee sent for the most learned doctors in the kingdom,
to see if there was still any spark of life remaining;
all said that the young Ranee was dead, beyond
reach of hope or help.</p>

<p>Then the Rajah and Ranee were very much grieved,
and mourned bitterly; and because they desired that,
if possible, Rowjee Rajah should see his wife once
again, instead of burying her underground, they placed
her beneath a canopy in a beautiful tomb near a little
tank, and would go daily to visit the place and look at
her. Then did a wonder take place, such as had never
been known throughout the land before! Sodewa
Bai&rsquo;s body did not decay nor the color of her face
change; and a month afterward, when her husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
returned home, she looked as fair and lovely as on the
night on which she died. There was a fresh color in
her cheeks and on her lips; she seemed to be only
asleep. When poor Rowjee Rajah heard of her death
he was so broken-hearted they thought he also would
die. He cursed the evil fate that had obliged him to
go away and deprive him of hearing her last words, or
bidding her farewell, if he could not save her life; and
from morning to evening he would go to her tomb,
and rend the air with his passionate lamentations, and
looking through the grating to where she lay calm and
still under the canopy, say, before he went away, &ldquo;I
will take one last look at that fair face. To-morrow
Death may have set his seal upon it. Oh, loveliness,
too bright for earth! Oh, lost, lost wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah and Ranee feared that he would die or go
mad, and they tried to prevent his going to the tomb;
but all was of no avail; it seemed to be the only thing
he cared for in life.</p>

<p>Now the negress who had stolen Sodewa Bai&rsquo;s necklace
used to wear it all day long, but late each night,
on going to bed, she would take it off and put it by till
next morning, and whenever she took it off Sodewa
Bai&rsquo;s spirit returned to her again, and she lived till day
dawned and the negress put on the necklace, when she
again died. But as the tomb was far from any houses,
and the old Rajah and Ranee and Rowjee Rajah only
went there by day, nobody found this out. When
Sodewa Bai first came to life in this way, she felt very
much frightened to find herself there all alone in the
dark, and thought she was in prison; but afterward
she got more accustomed to it, and determined when
morning came to look about the place and find her way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
back to the palace, and recover the necklace she found
she had lost (for it would have been dangerous to go at
night through the jungles that surrounded the tomb,
where she could hear the wild beasts roaring all night
long); but morning never came, for whenever the
negress awoke and put on the golden beads Sodewa
Bai died. However, each night, when the Ranee came
to life, she would walk to the little tank by the tomb
and drink some of the cool water, and return; but food
she had none. Now, no pearls or precious stones fell
from her lips, because she had no one to talk to; but
each time she walked down to the tank she scattered
jewels on either side of her path; and one day, when
Rowjee Rajah went to the tomb, he noticed all these
jewels, and thinking it very strange (though he never
dreamed that his wife could come to life), determined
to watch and see whence they came. But although he
watched and waited long, he could not find out the
cause, because all day long Sodewa Bai lay still and
dead, and only came to life at night. It was just at this
time, two whole months after she had been buried, and
the night after the very day that Rowjee Rajah had
spent in watching by the tomb, that Sodewa Bai had a
little son; but directly after he was born day dawned,
and the mother died. The little lonely baby began
to cry, but no one was there to hear him; and, as it
chanced, the Rajah did not go the tomb that day, for
he thought, &ldquo;All yesterday I watched by the tomb and
saw nothing; instead, therefore, of going to-day, I will
wait till the evening, and then see again if I cannot find
out how the jewels came there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So at night he went to the place. When he got there
he heard a faint cry from inside the tomb, but what it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
was he knew not; perhaps it might be a Peri or an
evil spirit. As he was wondering the door opened and
Sodewa Bai crossed the courtyard to the tank with a
child in her arms, and as she walked showers of jewels
fell on both sides of her path. Rowjee Rajah thought
he must be in a dream; but when he saw the Ranee
drink some water from the tank and return toward the
tomb, he sprang up and hurried after her. Sodewa
Bai, hearing footsteps follow her, was frightened, and
running into the tomb, fastened the door. Then the
Rajah knocked at it, saying, &ldquo;Let me in; let me in.&rdquo;
She answered, &ldquo;Who are you? Are you a Rakshas or
a spirit?&rdquo; (For she thought, &ldquo;Perhaps this is some
cruel creature who will kill me and the child.&rdquo;) &ldquo;No,
no,&rdquo; cried the Rajah, &ldquo;I am no Rakshas, but your
husband. Let me in, Sodewa Bai, if you are indeed
alive.&rdquo; No sooner did he name her name than Sodewa
Bai knew his voice, and unbolted the door and let him
in. Then, when he saw her sitting on the tomb with
the baby on her lap, he fell down on his knees before
her, saying, &ldquo;Tell me, little wife, that this is not a
dream.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I am indeed alive,
and this our child was born last night; but every day I
die, for while you were away some one stole my golden
necklace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then for the first time Rowjee Rajah noticed that
the beads were no longer round her neck. So he bade
her fear nothing, for that he would assuredly recover
them and return; and going back to the palace, which
he reached in the early morning, he summoned before
him the whole household.</p>

<p>Then, upon the neck of the negress, servant to the
first Ranee, he saw Sodewa Bai&rsquo;s missing necklace, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
seizing it, ordered the guards to take the woman to
prison. The negress, frightened, confessed all she had
done by order of the first Ranee, and how, at her command,
she had stolen the necklace. And when the
Rajah learnt this he ordered that the first Ranee also
should be imprisoned for life, and he and his father
and mother all went together to the tomb, and placing
the lost beads round Sodewa Bai&rsquo;s neck, brought her
and the child back in triumph with them to the palace.
Then, at news of how the young Ranee had been restored
to life, there was great joy throughout all that
country, and many days were spent in rejoicings in
honor of that happy event; and for the rest of their
lives the old Rajah and Ranee, and Rowjee Rajah and
Sodewa Bai, and all the family, lived in health and
happiness.</p>

<br />
<i>CHANDRA&rsquo;S VENGEANCE.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a Sowkar&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> wife who had no
children; one day she went crying to her husband
and saying, &ldquo;What an unhappy woman I am to have
no children! If I had any children to amuse me I
should be quite happy.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Why should
you be miserable on that account; though you have no
children, your sister has eight or nine; why not adopt
one of hers?&rdquo; The Sowkar&rsquo;s wife agreed, and, adopting
one of her sister&rsquo;s little boys, who was only six
months old, brought him up as her own son. Some
time afterward, when the child was one day returning
from school, he and one of his schoolfellows quarreled
and began to fight, and the other boy (being much the
older and stronger of the two) gave him a great blow
on the head and knocked him down, and hurt him very
much. The boy ran crying home, and the Sowkar&rsquo;s
wife bathed his head and bandaged it up, but she did
not send and punish the boy who hurt him, for she
thought, &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t keep children shut up always in
the house, and they will be fighting together sometimes
and hurting themselves.&rdquo; Then the child grumbled to
himself, saying, &ldquo;This is only my aunt; that is why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
she did not punish the other boy. If she had been my
mother, she would certainly have given him a great
knock on his head to punish him for knocking mine,
but because she is only my aunt, I suppose she doesn&rsquo;t
care.&rdquo; The Sowkar&rsquo;s wife overheard him, and felt very
much grieved, saying, &ldquo;This little child, whom I have
watched over from his babyhood, does not love me as
if I were his mother. It is of no use; he is not my
own, and he will never care for me as such.&rdquo; So she
took him home to his own mother, saying, &ldquo;Sister, I
have brought you back your child.&rdquo; &ldquo;How is this?&rdquo;
asked her sister. &ldquo;You adopted him as yours for all
his life. Why do you now bring him back?&rdquo; The
Sowkar&rsquo;s wife did not tell her sister what she had heard
the boy say, but she answered, &ldquo;Very well; let him be
yours and mine: he shall live a while with you, and
then come and visit me; we will both take care of
him.&rdquo; And returning to her husband, she told him
what she had done, saying &ldquo;All my pains are useless;
you know how kind I have been to my sister&rsquo;s boy,
yet, after all I have done for him, at the end of seven
years he does not love me as well as he does his mother,
whom he had scarcely seen. Now, therefore, I will
never rest until I have seen Mahdeo<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and asked him to
grant that I may have a child of my own.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a foolish woman you are!&rdquo; answered her
husband; &ldquo;why not be content with your lot? How
do you think you will find Mahdeo? Do you know
the road to heaven?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I
will seek for it until I find it out, and if I never find it,
it cannot be helped, but I will return home no more
unless my prayer is answered.&rdquo; So she left the house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
and wandered into the jungle, and after she had traveled
through it for many, many days, and left her own
land very far behind, she came to the borders of another
country, even the Madura Tinivelly<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> country,
where a great river rolled down toward the sea. On
the river-bank sat two women&mdash;a Ranee named Coplinghee
Ranee and a Nautch woman.</p>

<p>Now, neither the Ranee, the Nautch woman nor the
Sowkar&rsquo;s wife had ever seen each other before they met
at the river-side. Then, as she sat down to rest and
drink some of the water, the Ranee turned to the Sowkar&rsquo;s
wife and said to her, &ldquo;Who are you, and where
are you going?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I am a Sowkar&rsquo;s wife
from a far country, and because I was very unhappy at
having no children, I am going to find Mahdeo and ask
him to grant that I may have a child of my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, in her turn, she said to the Ranee, &ldquo;And
pray who are you, and where are you going?&rdquo; The
Ranee answered, &ldquo;I am Coplinghee Ranee, queen of
all this country, but neither money nor riches can give
me joy, for I have no children; I therefore am going to
seek Mahdeo and ask him to grant that I may have a
child.&rdquo; Then Coplinghee Ranee asked the Nautch
woman the same question, saying, &ldquo;And who may
you be, and where are you going?&rdquo; The Nautch
woman answered, &ldquo;I am a dancing woman and I also
have no children, and am going to seek Mahdeo and
pray to him for a child.&rdquo; At hearing this, the Sowkar&rsquo;s
wife said, &ldquo;Since we are all journeying on the same
errand, why should we not go together?&rdquo; To this
Coplinghee Ranee and the Dancing woman agreed, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
they all three continued their journey together through
the jungle.</p>

<p>On, on, on they went, every day further and further;
they never stayed to rest nor saw another human being.
Their feet ached dreadfully and their clothes wore out,
and they had nothing to live on but the jungle plants,
wild berries and seeds. So weary and worn did they
become that they looked like three poor old beggar
women. Never had they by night-time sleep nor by
day-time rest; and so, hour after hour, month after
month, year after year, they traveled on.</p>

<p>At last one day they came to where, in the midst of
the jungle, there rolled a great river of fire. It was
the biggest river they had ever seen, and made of flames
instead of water. There was no one on this side and
no one on that&mdash;no way of getting across but by walking
through the fire.</p>

<p>When Coplinghee Ranee and the Nautch woman
saw this, they said, &ldquo;Alas! here is the end of all our
pains and trouble. All hope is over, for we can go no
farther.&rdquo; But the Sowkar&rsquo;s wife answered, &ldquo;Shall we
be deterred by this after having come so far? Nay,
rather seek a way across the fire.&rdquo; And so saying, she
stepped into the fire waves; the others, however, were
afraid, and would not go. When the Sowkar&rsquo;s wife had
half crossed the river of fire, she turned, and waving her
hands toward them, said, &ldquo;Come on, come on, do not be
afraid. The fire does not burn me. I go to find Mahdeo;
perhaps he is on the other side.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> But they still
refused, saying, &ldquo;We cannot come, but we will wait
here until your return; and if you find Mahdeo, pray
for us also, that we may have children.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
So the Sowkar&rsquo;s wife went on her way, and the fire-waves
lapped round her feet as if they had been water,
but they did not hurt her.</p>

<p>When she reached the other side of the river she came
upon a great wilderness, full of wild elephants, and
bison, and lions, and tigers, and bears, that roared and
growled on every side. But she did not turn back for
fear of them, for she said to herself, &ldquo;I can but die
once, and it is better that they should kill me than that
I should return without finding Mahdeo.&rdquo; And all the
wild beasts allowed her to pass through the midst of
them and did her no harm.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that Mahdeo looked down from
heaven and saw her, and when he saw her he pitied her
greatly, for she had been twelve years wandering upon
the face of the earth to find him. Then he caused a
beautiful mango tree, beside a fair well, to spring up in
the desert to give her rest and refreshment, and he himself,
in the disguise of a Gosain Fakeer, came and stood
by the tree. But the Sowkar&rsquo;s wife would not stay to
gather the fruit or drink the water; she did not so much
as notice the Fakeer, but walked straight on in her
weary search for Mahdeo. Then he called after her,
&ldquo;Bai, Bai, where are you going? Come here.&rdquo; She
answered, scarcely looking at him, &ldquo;It matters not to
you, Fakeer, where I am going. You tell your prayer-beads
and leave me alone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; he cried;
&ldquo;come here.&rdquo; But she would not, so Mahdeo went
and stood in front of her, no longer disguised as a
Fakeer, but shining brightly, the Lord of Kylas<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> in all
his beauty, and at the sight of him the poor Sowkar&rsquo;s
wife fell down on the ground and kissed his feet, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
he said to her, &ldquo;Tell me, Bai, where are you going?&rdquo;
She answered, &ldquo;Sir, I seek Mahdeo, to pray him to
grant that I may have a child, but for twelve years I
have looked for him in vain.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Seek no
further, for I am Mahdeo; take this mango,&rdquo; and he
gathered one off the tree that grew by the well, &ldquo;and
eat it, and it shall come to pass that when you return
home you shall have a child.&rdquo; Then she said, &ldquo;Sir,
three women came seeking you, but two stayed by the
river of fire, for they were afraid; may not they also
have children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;you may give them
some of your mango, and then they also will each have
a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he faded from her sight, and the Sowkar&rsquo;s
wife returned glad and joyful, through the wilderness and
the river of fire, to where the Ranee and the Dancing
woman were waiting for her on the other side. When
they saw her, they said, &ldquo;Well, Sowkar&rsquo;s wife, what
news?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I have found Mahdeo, and
he has given me this mango, of which if we eat we
shall each have a child.&rdquo; And she took the mango,
and squeezing it gave the juice to the Ranee, and the
skin she gave to the Nautch woman, and the pulp and
the stone she ate herself.</p>

<p>Then these three women returned to their own homes;
Coplinghee Ranee and the Dancing woman to the Madura
Tinivelly country, and the Sowkar&rsquo;s wife to very,
very far beyond that, even the land where her husband
lived, and whence she had first started on her journey.</p>

<p>But on their return all their friends only laughed at
them, and the Sowkar said to his wife, &ldquo;I cannot see
much good in your mad twelve-years&rsquo; journey; you only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
come back looking like a beggar, and all the world
laughs at you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I have seen Mahdeo
and eaten of the mango, and I shall have a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And within a little while it came to pass that there
was born to the Sowkar and his wife a little son, and
on the very same day Coplinghee Ranee had a daughter
and the Nautch woman had a daughter.</p>

<p>Then were they all very happy, and sent everywhere
to tell their friends the good news; and each gave,
according to her power, a great feast to the poor as a
thank-offering to Mahdeo, who had been merciful to
them. And the Sowkar&rsquo;s wife called her son &ldquo;Koila,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
in memory of the mango stone; and the Nautch woman
called her daughter &ldquo;Moulee;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and the little Princess
was named Chandra Bai,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> for she was as fair and beautiful
as the white moon.</p>

<p>Chandra Ranee was very beautiful, the most beautiful
child in all that country, so pretty and delicately made
that everybody, when they saw her, loved her. She
was born, moreover, with, on her ankles, two of the
most costly anklets that ever were seen. They were
made of gold and very precious stones, dazzling to look
at, like the sun. No one had ever seen any like them
before. Every day, as the baby grew, these bangles
grew, and round them were little bells, which tinkled
when any one came near. Chandra&rsquo;s parents were very
happy and proud, and sent for all the wise men in the
kingdom to tell her fortune. But the most learned
Brahmin of them all, when he saw her, said, &ldquo;This
child must be sent out of the country at once, for if she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
stays in it she will destroy all the land with fire, and
burn it utterly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rajah, at hearing these words, was very angry,
and said to the Brahmin, &ldquo;I will cut off your head, for
you tell lies and not the truth.&rdquo; The Brahmin answered,
&ldquo;Cut off my head if you will, but it is the truth I speak,
and no lie. If you do not believe me, let a little wool
be fetched, and put it upon the child, that you may know
my words are true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they fetched some wool and laid it upon the baby,
and no sooner had they done so than it all blazed up
and burnt till not a bit was left, and it scorched the
hands of the attendants.</p>

<p>Then the Brahmin said, &ldquo;As this fire has burnt the
wool, so will this Princess one day, if she comes here,
burn this whole land.&rdquo; And they were all very much
frightened, and the Rajah said to the Ranee, &ldquo;This
being so, the child must be sent out of the country
instantly.&rdquo; The poor Ranee thereat was very sad, and
she did all in her power to save her little baby, but the
Rajah would not hear of it, and commanded that the
Princess should be placed in a large box, and taken to
the borders of his land, where a great river rolled down
to the sea, and there thrown into the stream, that it
might carry her far, far away, each minute farther from
her native land.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Then the Ranee caused a beautiful
golden box to be made, and put her little baby in it with
many tears (since all her efforts to save it were of no
avail), and it was taken away and thrown into the river.</p>

<p>The box floated on, and on, and on, until at last it
reached the country where the Sowkar and the Sowkar&rsquo;s
wife lived. Now it chanced that, just as the box
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
was floating by, the Sowkar, who had gone down to the
river to wash his face, caught sight of it, and seeing a
Fisherman not far off prepared to throw his net into the
water, he cried, &ldquo;Run, Fisherman, run, run; do not
stop to fish, but cast your net over that glittering box and
bring it here to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not, unless you promise me that the box
shall be mine,&rdquo; said the Fisherman. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo;
answered the Sowkar, &ldquo;the box shall be yours, and
whatever it contains shall belong to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Fisherman cast his net in that part of the
river and dragged the box ashore.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know which was most astonished&mdash;the Merchant
or the Fisherman&mdash;when they saw what a prize
they had found. For the box was composed entirely
of gold and precious stones, and within it lay the most
lovely little child that ever was seen.</p>

<p>She seemed a little Princess, for her dress was all
made of cloth of gold, and on her feet were two
anklets that shone like the sun.</p>

<p>When the Sowkar opened the box, she smiled; and
stretched out her little arms toward him. Then he
was pleased, and said, &ldquo;Fisherman, the box is yours,
but this child must belong to me.&rdquo; The Fisherman was
content that it should be so, for he had many children
of his own at home, and wanted no more, but was
glad to have the golden box; while the Sowkar, who
had only his one little son and was rich, did not care
for the box, but was well pleased to have the baby.</p>

<p>He took her home to his wife, and said, &ldquo;See, wife,
here is a pretty little daughter-in-law for us. Here is
a wife for your little son.&rdquo; And when the Sowkar&rsquo;s
wife saw the child looking so beautiful and smiling so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
sweetly, her heart was glad and she loved her, and
from that day took the greatest care of her, just as if
the baby girl had been her own daughter. And when
Chandra Ranee was a year old they married her to
their son, Koila.</p>

<p>Years wore on, and the Sowkar and his wife were in
a good old age gathered to their fathers. Meantime,
Koila and Chandra had grown up the handsomest
couple in all the country: Koila tall and straight, with
a face like a young lion, and Chandra as lithe and
graceful as a palm tree, with a face calm and beautiful
like the silver moonlight.</p>

<p>Meantime Moulee, the Nautch woman&rsquo;s daughter
(and third of the mango children), had likewise grown
up in the Madura Tinivelly country, and was also very
fair&mdash;fairer than any one in all the land around. Moreover,
she danced and sang more beautifully than any
of the other Nautch girls. Her voice was clear as the
voice of a quail, and it rang through the air with
such power that the sound could be heard a twelve-days&rsquo;
journey off. The Nautch people used to travel
about from place to place, staying one day in one town
and the next in another, and so it happened that in
their wanderings they reached the borders of the land
where Koila and Chandra lived.</p>

<p>One morning Koila heard the sound of singing in the
distance, and it pleased him so well that he determined
to try and discover who it was that possessed such an
exquisite voice. For twelve days he journeyed on
through the jungle, each day hearing the singing repeated
louder and louder, yet still without reaching the
place whence it came. At last, on the twelfth day, he
got close to the Nautch people&rsquo;s encampment, not far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
from a large town, and there saw the singer (who was
none other than Moulee), singing and dancing in the
midst of a great crowd of people who had collected
around her. In her hand she held a garland of flowers,
which she waved over her head as she danced.</p>

<p>Koila was so charmed with the sound of her voice that
he felt spell-bound, and stood where he was, far off on
the outskirts of the jungle, listening, without going any
nearer.</p>

<p>When the entertainment was over, all the people
crowded round Moulee, saying, &ldquo;Why should you,
who have such a beautiful voice, go away and leave
our city? Marry one of us, and then you will stay here
always.&rdquo; Then, the number of her suitors being so
great that she did not know whom to choose, she said,
&ldquo;Very well; he on whose neck this garland falls shall
be my husband.&rdquo; And waving the flowers she held
two or three times round her head, she threw them
from her with her utmost force.</p>

<p>The impetus given to the garland was so great that
it swung through the air beyond the crowd and fell
upon the neck of Koila as he stood by the borders of
the jungle. And the people ran to see who was the
fortunate possessor, and when they saw Koila they
were astonished, for he looked more beautiful than
any of the sons of men: it was as if an immortal had
suddenly come among them. And the Nautch people
dragged him back to their camp, crying, &ldquo;You have
won the garland; you must be Moulee&rsquo;s husband.&rdquo;
He answered, &ldquo;I only came here to look on; I cannot
stay. This is not my country; I have a wife of my
own at home.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is nothing to us,&rdquo; they said;
&ldquo;it is your destiny to marry Moulee&mdash;Moulee the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
beautiful one&mdash;Moulee, whose voice you heard and who
dances so well. You must marry her, for the garland
fell on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now so it was, that though Koila was very kind to
his wife, he did not love her as well as she loved him
(perhaps it was that, having been accustomed to her
from a child, Chandra&rsquo;s goodness and beauty struck
him less than it did other people); and instead of thinking
how unhappy she would be if he did not return,
and going back at once, he stopped and hesitated and
debated what to do. And the Nautch people gave him
a drink that was a very powerful spell, insomuch that
he soon totally forgot about his own home, and was
married to Moulee, the Nautch girl, and lived among
the Nautch people for many months. At last, one day,
Moulee&rsquo;s mother (the very Nautch woman who had
gone with Coplinghee Ranee and the Sowkar&rsquo;s wife to
find Mahdeo) said to Koila, &ldquo;Son-in-law, you are a
lazy fellow; you have been here now for a long time,
but you do nothing for your support; it is we who
have to pay for your food, we who have to provide your
clothes. Go now and fetch us some money, or I will
turn you out of the house, and you shall never see
your wife Moulee again.&rdquo; Koila had no money to give
his mother-in-law: then, for the first time he bethought
him of his own country and of Chandra, and he said
&ldquo;My first wife, who lives in my own country, has on
her feet two bangles of very great value; let me return
home and fetch one of them to sell, which will more
than pay whatever I owe you.&rdquo; The Nautch people
consented. So Koila returned to his own home, and
told Chandra what he wanted the money for, and asked
her to let him have one of her bangles; but she refused,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
saying, &ldquo;You have been away a long, long time, and
left me all alone, and chosen for your second wife one
of the Nautch people, and become one of them;
and now you want to take one of my bangles&mdash;the
bangles that I had when a little child, that have
grown with my growth, and never been taken off&mdash;and
to give it to your other wife. This shall not be; go
back, if you will, to your new friends, but I will not
give you my bangle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He answered, &ldquo;They gave me an enchanted drink
which made me forget you for a time, but I am weary
of them all; let me but go and pay my mother-in-law
the money I owe her for food and clothes, and I will
return and live in my own land, for you are my first
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you may take the bangle and
sell it, and give the money to your second wife&rsquo;s mother,
but take me also with you when you go; do not leave
me here all alone again.&rdquo; Koila agreed, and they both
set off together toward the Madura Tinivelly country.</p>

<p>As they journeyed, Krishnaswami,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> who was playing
at cards with his three wives, saw them, and when he
saw them he laughed. Then his wives said to him,
&ldquo;Why do you laugh? You have not laughed for such
a long time: what amuses you so much now?&rdquo; He
answered, &ldquo;I am laughing to see Koila and his wife
Chandra Ranee journeying toward the Madura Tinivelly
country. He is going to sell his wife&rsquo;s bangle,
and he will only be killed, and then she in anger will
burn up all the country. O foolish people!&rdquo; The
goddesses answered, &ldquo;This is a very dreadful thing; let
us go in disguise and warn him not to enter the country.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
&ldquo;It would be useless,&rdquo; said Krishnaswami; &ldquo;if you do,
he will only laugh at you and get angry with you.&rdquo;
But the goddesses determined to do their best to avert
the threatened calamity. So they disguised themselves
as old fortune-tellers, and went out with little lamps
and their sacred books to meet Koila as he came along
the road, followed by his wife. Then they said to him,
&ldquo;Come not into the Madura Tinivelly country, for if
you come you will be killed, and your wife in her fury
will burn all the land with fire.&rdquo; At first, Koila would
not listen to them; then he bade them go away; and
lastly, when they continued warning him, got angry and
beat them out of his path, saying, &ldquo;Do you think I am
to be frightened out of the country by a parcel of old
crones like you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Krishnaswami&rsquo;s three wives returned to him,
much enraged at the treatment they had received; but
he only said to them, &ldquo;Did not I tell you not to go,
warning you that it would be useless?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On getting near the Rajah&rsquo;s capital, Koila and Chandra
came to the house of an old milk-seller, who was
very kind to them and gave them food and shelter for
the night. Next morning Koila said to his wife, &ldquo;You
had better stay here; this good old woman will take
care of you while I go into the town to sell your bangle.&rdquo;
Chandra agreed, and remained at the old woman&rsquo;s house
while her husband went into the town. Of course he
did not know that the Rajah and his wife (the Coplinghee
Ranee) were Chandra&rsquo;s father and mother, any
more than they, or Chandra herself, knew it, or than
the three mango children knew the story of their mothers&rsquo;
journey in search of Mahdeo.</p>

<p>Now a short time before Koila and Chandra reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
the Madura Tinivelly country, Coplinghee Ranee had
sent a very handsome pair of bangles to a Jeweler in
the town to be cleaned. It chanced that in a high tree
close to the Jeweler&rsquo;s house two eagles had built their
nest, and the young eagles, who were very noisy birds,
used to scream all day long and greatly disturb the
Jeweler&rsquo;s family. So one day, when the old birds were
away, the Jeweler&rsquo;s son climbed up the tree and pulled
down the nest, and put the young eagles to death.
When the old birds returned home and saw what was
done, it grieved them very much, and they said, &ldquo;These
cruel people have killed our children; let us punish
them.&rdquo; And seeing in the porch one of Coplinghee
Ranee&rsquo;s beautiful bangles, which the Jeweler had just
been cleaning, they swooped down and flew away with
it.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The Jeweler did not know what to do: he said to his
wife, &ldquo;To buy such a bangle as that would cost more
than all our fortune, and to make one like it would take
many, many years; I dare not say I have lost it, or they
would think I had stolen it and put me to death. The
only thing I can do is to delay returning the other as
long as possible, and try somehow to get one like it.&rdquo;
So next day, when the Ranee sent to inquire if her
bangles were ready, he answered, &ldquo;They are not ready
yet; they will be ready to-morrow.&rdquo; And the next day
and the next he said the same thing. At last the Ranee&rsquo;s
messengers got very angry at the continued delays; then,
seeing he could no longer make excuses, the Jeweler sent
the one bangle by them to the palace, beautifully cleaned,
with a message that the other also would shortly be
ready; but all this time he was hunting for a bangle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
costly enough to take the Ranee as a substitute for the
one the eagles had carried away. Such a bangle, however,
he could not find.</p>

<p>When Koila reached the town, he spread out a sheet
in the corner of a street near the market-place, and,
placing the bangle upon it, sat down close by, waiting
for customers. Now he was very, very handsome.
Although dressed so plainly, he looked like a Prince,
and the bangle he had to sell flashed in the morning
light like seven suns. Such a handsome youth and
such a beautiful bangle the people had never seen
before; and many passers-by, with chattees on their
heads, for watching him, let the chattees tumble down
and break, they were so much astonished; and several
men and women, who were looking out of the windows
of their houses, leant too far forward and fell into the
street, so giddy did they become from wonder and
amazement!</p>

<p>But no one could be found to buy the bangle, for they
all said, &ldquo;We could not afford to buy such jewels; this
bangle is fit only for a Ranee to wear.&rdquo; At last, when
the day had nearly gone, who should come by but the
Jeweler who had been employed to clean Coplinghee
Ranee&rsquo;s bangles, and was in search of one to replace
that which the eagles had stolen. No sooner did he
see the one belonging to Chandra, which Koila was
trying to sell, than he said to himself, &ldquo;That is the very
thing I want, if I can only get it.&rdquo; So he called his
wife, and said to her, &ldquo;Go to that bangle-seller and
speak kindly to him; say that the day is nearly gone,
and invite him to come and lodge at our house for the
night. For if we can make friends with him and get
him to trust us, I shall be able to take the bangle from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
him and say he stole it from me. And as he is a
stranger here, every one will believe my word rather
than his. This bangle is exactly the very thing for me
to take Coplinghee Ranee, for it is very like her own,
only more beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Jeweler&rsquo;s wife did as she was told, and then the
Jeweler himself went up to Koila and said to him,
&ldquo;You are a bangle-seller, and I am a bangle-seller;
therefore I look upon you as a brother. Come home,
I pray you, with us, as my wife begs you to do, and we
will give you food and shelter for the night, since you
are a stranger in this country.&rdquo; So these cunning people
coaxed Koila to go home with them to their home,
and pretended to be very kind to him, and gave him
supper, and a bed to rest on for the night; but next
morning early the Jeweler raised a hue and cry and
sent for the police, and bade them take Koila before
the Rajah instantly, since he had stolen and tried to
sell one of Coplinghee Ranee&rsquo;s bangles, which he (the
Jeweler) had been given to clean. It was in vain that
Koila protested his innocence, and declared that the
bangle he had belonged to his wife; he was a stranger&mdash;nobody
would believe him. They dragged him
to the palace, and the Jeweler accused him to the
Rajah, saying, &ldquo;This man tried to steal the Ranee&rsquo;s
bangle (which I had been given to clean) and to sell it.
If he had done so, you would have thought I had
stolen it, and killed me; I demand, therefore, that he
in punishment shall be put to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they sent for the Ranee to show her the bangle,
but as soon as she saw it she recognized it as one of the
bangles which had belonged to Chandra, and burst into
tears, crying, &ldquo;This is not my bangle. Oh, my lord,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>308]</a></span>
no jeweler on earth made this bangle! See, it is different
to mine; and when any one comes near it, it tinkles
and all the little bells begin to ring. Have you
forgotten it? This was my beauty&rsquo;s bangle! My diamond&rsquo;s!
My little darling&rsquo;s! My lost child&rsquo;s! Where
did it come from? How did it come here? How into
this land, and into this town and bazaar, among these
wicked people? For this Jeweler must have kept my
bangle and brought this one in its place. No human
goldsmith&rsquo;s hands made this, for it is none other than
Chandra&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Then she begged the Rajah to inquire
further about it.</p>

<p>But they all thought her mad; and the Jeweler said,
&ldquo;It is the Ranee&rsquo;s fancy, for this is the same bangle
she gave me to clean.&rdquo; The other people also agreed
that both the bangles were almost exactly alike, and
must be a pair; and it being certain that Koila had had
the bangle when he was seized by the police, the Rajah
ordered him to be instantly executed. But the Ranee
took Chandra&rsquo;s bangle and locked it away in a strong
cupboard, apart from all her other jewels.</p>

<p>Then they took Koila out into the jungle and would
have cut off his head, but he said to his guards, &ldquo;If I
must die, let me die by my own hands,&rdquo; and drawing
his sword he fell upon it, and as the sword was very
sharp it cut his body in two&mdash;one half fell on one side
of the sword, and the other half on the other side&mdash;and
they left his body where it fell.</p>

<p>When the news of what had taken place came to the
town, many people who had seen Koila selling his bangle
the day before began to murmur, saying, &ldquo;There
must be some injustice here&mdash;the Rajah has been over-hasty.
Most likely the poor man did not steal the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>309]</a></span>
bangle. It is not likely that he would have tried to sell
it openly before us all in the bazaar if it had been
stolen property. How cruel of the Rajah to put such
a handsome, gentle, noble-looking youth to death!&mdash;and
he was a stranger, too!&rdquo; And many wept at
thought of his hard fate. When the Rajah heard of
this he was very angry, and sent and commanded that
the matter should be no further discussed in the town,
saying, &ldquo;If any one speaks another word of what has
been done, or laments or sheds tears for the dead, he
shall be instantly hanged.&rdquo; Then the people all felt
very frightened, and not a soul dared to speak of Koila,
though every one thought about him much.</p>

<p>Early the very morning that this happened the old
milk-seller (at whose house, which was a little out of
the town, Chandra had been sleeping) took her guest
a bowl full of milk to drink; but no sooner had Chandra
tasted it than she began to cry, saying, &ldquo;Good
mother, what have you done? my mouth is full of
blood!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no, my daughter,&rdquo; answered the old
woman; &ldquo;you must have been dreaming some bad
dream. See, this is pure, fresh, warm milk I have
brought you; drink again.&rdquo; But when Chandra tasted
it for the second time, she answered, &ldquo;Oh no! oh no!
it is not milk that I taste, but blood. All last night I
had a dreadful dream, and this morning when I woke
I found that my marriage necklace had snapped in two;
and now this milk tastes to me as blood. Let me go!
let me go! for I know my husband is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman tried to comfort her, saying, &ldquo;Why
should you fancy he is dead? he was quite well yesterday,
when he went to sell your bangle; and he said he
would come back to you soon; in a little while, very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
likely, he will be here.&rdquo; But she answered, &ldquo;No, no;
I feel sure that he is dead! Oh, let me go! for I must
find him before I die.&rdquo; Then the old woman said,
&ldquo;You must not go; you are too beautiful to run about
through the streets of this strange town alone, and
your husband would be very angry if he saw you
doing so; and who knows but that you might lose
your way, and get carried off as a slave; remember, he
told you to stay here till he returned. Be patient; remain
where you are, and I will go quickly into the
town and seek your husband. If he is alive, I will
bring him back to you, and if he is dead I will bring
you word.&rdquo; So, taking a chattee full of milk on her
head, as if to sell, she went to the town to find Koila,
while every minute seemed an hour to Chandra until
her return.</p>

<p>When the old milk-seller reached the town, she went
up and down all the streets looking for Koila, or expecting
to hear some one mention the handsome
stranger who had gone to sell such a wonderful bangle
the day before. But she could not find him, nor did
she hear him spoken of, for all were afraid to say a
word about him on account of the Rajah&rsquo;s decree.
Being unable to trace him, the old woman got suspicious,
and began to search, more carefully than before,
down all the streets near the market-place, where she
thought he was most likely to have gone; but, lest
people should wonder at her errand, she called out
each time as if she had some different thing to sell.
First, &ldquo;Buy some milk&mdash;who&rsquo;ll buy milk&mdash;who&rsquo;ll
buy?&rdquo; Then, on going for a second time down the
same street, &ldquo;Buy butter&mdash;butter! very fine butter!&rdquo;
and so on. At last one woman, who had been watching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
her with some curiosity, said, &ldquo;Old woman, what
nonsense you talk! you have been half-a-dozen times
up and down this same street, as if you had half-a-dozen
different things to sell in that one chattee. Any
one would think you had as little sense as that pretty
young bangle-seller yesterday, who spent all the day
trying to sell a bangle, and got put to death for his
pains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of whom do you speak?&rdquo; asked the old woman.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I suppose, as you&rsquo;re a milk-seller
from the country, you know nothing about it.
But that&rsquo;s not to be talked about, for the Rajah has said
that whoever speaks of him or mourns him shall be
instantly hanged. Ah! he was very handsome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; whispered the old woman.
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; answered the other; &ldquo;you can see the place
where that crowd of people has collected. The Rajah&rsquo;s
Jeweler accused him of having stolen the bangle; so
he was executed, many thought unjustly; but do not
say I said it.&rdquo; And so saying, she pointed toward the
jungle some way off. The old woman ran to the
place, but when she there saw two halves of Koila&rsquo;s
body lying side by side, stiff and cold, she threw her
earthen chattee down on the ground and fell on her
knees, crying bitterly. The noise attracted the attention
of the Rajah&rsquo;s guards, some of whom immediately
seized her, saying, &ldquo;Old woman, it is against the law
to lament that dead man or murmur at the Rajah&rsquo;s decree;
you deserve to be put to death.&rdquo; But she
answered quickly, &ldquo;The dead man! I do not cry for
the dead man: can you not see that my chattee is
broken and all the milk spilt? Is it not enough to
make one weep?&rdquo; And she began to cry again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>312]</a></span>
&ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; they answered; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t cry; come,
the chattee wasn&rsquo;t worth much; it was only an earthen
thing. Stop your tears, and maybe we&rsquo;ll give you a
chattee of gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I neither care for your golden chattees nor for
silver,&rdquo; she said, angrily. &ldquo;Go away; go away! my
earthen chattee was worth them all. My grandfather&rsquo;s
grandfather and my grandmother&rsquo;s grandmother used
this chattee; and to think that it should now be broken
and all the milk spilt!&rdquo; And picking up the broken
pieces, she went home sobbing, as if the loss of her
chattee was all her grief. But when she got to her own
house, she ran into where Chandra was, crying, &ldquo;Alas!
my pretty child! alas, my daughter! your fears are
true!&rdquo; and as gently as she could she told her what
had happened.</p>

<p>No sooner did Chandra hear it than she ran away
straight to the Rajah&rsquo;s palace in the midst of the town,
and rushing into the room where he was, said, &ldquo;How
did you dare to kill my husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, at the sound of her voice, her bangle, which
the Ranee had locked up in the cupboard, broke
through all the intervening doors and rolled to Chandra&rsquo;s
feet.</p>

<p>The Rajah was unable to answer her a word. Then
she fell on her knees and rent her clothes and tore her
hair; and when she tore it all the land began to burn
and all her hair burned too.</p>

<p>Then the old milk-seller, who had followed her, ran
and put a lump of butter on her head, thinking to cool
it; and two other woman, who were by, fetched water
to pour upon her hair, but by this time nineteen lines
of houses were in flames. Then the old woman cried,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh! spare the Purwari<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> lines; don&rsquo;t burn them down,
for I did all I could for you.&rdquo; So Chandra did not
burn that part of the town near which the old woman
and her friends lived. But the fire burnt on and on in
the other direction; and it killed the Rajah and the
Ranee and all the people in the palace, and the wicked
Jeweler and his wife; and as he was dying Chandra
tore out his heart and gave it to the eagles who hovered
overhead, saying, &ldquo;Here is vengeance for the death of
your little ones.&rdquo; And the Nautch girl, Moulee, and
her mother, who were watching the fire from far off,
were smothered in the flames.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Then Chandra went to where Koila&rsquo;s dead body lay
and wept over it bitterly; and as she was weeping,
there fell down to her from heaven a needle and
thread; and she took them, saying, &ldquo;Oh, that I could
by any means restore you!&rdquo; and, placing the two halves
of his body side by side, she sewed them together.</p>

<p>And when she had done this, she cried to Mahdeo,
saying, &ldquo;Sire, I have done the best I can; I have
joined the body; give it life.&rdquo; And as she said these
words Mahdeo had pity on her, and he sent Koila&rsquo;s
spirit back and it returned to his body again. Then
Chandra was glad, and they returned and lived in their
own land.</p>

<p>But to this day in the Madura Tinivelly country you
can trace where all the land was burnt.</p>

<br />
<i>HOW THE THREE CLEVER MEN OUTWITTED
THE DEMONS.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once upon a time a very rich man who
had a very beautiful wife, and this man&rsquo;s chief
amusement used to be shooting with a bow and arrow,
at which he was so clever that every morning he would
shoot through one of the pearls in his wife&rsquo;s nose-ring
without hurting her at all.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> One fine day, that was a
holiday, the Pearl-shooter&rsquo;s brother-in-law came to take
his sister to their father and mother&rsquo;s house to pay her
own family a little visit; and when he saw her, he said,
&ldquo;Why do you look so pale and thin and miserable? is
your husband unkind to you, or what is the matter?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;my husband is very kind to me,
and I have plenty of money and jewels, and as nice a
house as I could wish; my only grief is that every
morning he amuses himself by shooting one of the
pearls from my nose-ring, and that frightens me; for I
think perhaps some day he may miss his aim and the
arrow run into my face and kill me. So I am in constant
terror of my life; yet I do not like to ask him not
to do it, because it gives him so much pleasure; but if
he left off of his own accord, I should be very glad.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What does he say to you himself about it?&rdquo; asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
the brother. &ldquo;Every day,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;when he has
shot the pearl, he comes to me quite happy and proud,
and says, &lsquo;Was there ever a man as clever as I am?&rsquo;
and I answer him, &lsquo;No, I do not think there ever was
any as clever as you.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not say so again,&rdquo; said
the brother; &ldquo;but next time he asks you the question,
answer, &lsquo;Yes, there are many men in the world more
clever than you.&rsquo;&rdquo; The Pearl-shooter&rsquo;s wife promised
to take her brother&rsquo;s advice. So, next time her husband
shot the pearl from her nose-ring, and said to her, &ldquo;Was
there ever a man as clever as I am?&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;Yes, there are many men in the world more clever
than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he said, &ldquo;If so be that there are, I will not
rest until I have found them.&rdquo; And he left her, and
went a far journey into the jungle in order to find, if
possible, a cleverer man than himself. On, on, on he
journeyed a very long way, until at last he came to a
large river, and on the river-bank sat a traveler eating
his dinner. The Pearl-shooter sat down beside
him and the two began conversing together. At last,
the Pearl-shooter said to his friend, &ldquo;What is the reason
of your journey, and where are you going?&rdquo; The
stranger answered, &ldquo;I am a Wrestler, and the strongest
man in all this country; I can do many wonderful
things in the way of wrestling and carrying heavy
weights, and I began to think that in all this world
there was no one so clever as I; but I have lately heard
of a still more wonderful man who lives in a distant
country, and who is so clever that every morning he
shoots one of the pearls from his wife&rsquo;s nose-ring without
hurting her. So I go to find him, and learn if this
is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
The Pearl-shooter answered, &ldquo;Then you need travel
no further, for I am that man of whom you heard.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why are you traveling about, then, and where are you
going?&rdquo; asked the Wrestler. &ldquo;I,&rdquo; replied the other,
&ldquo;am also traveling to see if in all the world I can find
a cleverer man than myself; therefore, as we have both
the same object in view, let us be as brothers and go
about together; perhaps there is still in the world a
better man than we.&rdquo; The Wrestler agreed; so they
both started on their way together. They had not gone
very far before they came to a place where three roads
met, and there sat another man, whom neither of them
had ever seen before. He accosted the Wrestler and
the Pearl-shooter and said to them, &ldquo;Who are you,
friends, and where are you going?&rdquo; &ldquo;We,&rdquo; answered
they, &ldquo;are two clever men, who are traveling through
the world to see if we can find a cleverer man than we;
but who may you be, and where are you going?&rdquo; &ldquo;I,&rdquo;
replied the third man, &ldquo;am a Pundit,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> a man of memory,
renowned for my good head, a great thinker; and
verily I thought there was not in the world a more
wonderful man than I; but having heard of two men
in distant lands of very great cleverness, the one of
whom is a Wrestler, and the other a shooter of pearls
from his wife&rsquo;s nose-ring, I go to find them and learn
if the things I heard are true.&rdquo; &ldquo;They are true,&rdquo; said
the others; &ldquo;for we, O Pundit, are the very two men
of whom you speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this news the Pundit was overjoyed, and cried,
&ldquo;Then let us be as brothers; since your homes are far
distant, return with me to my house, which is close by;
there you can rest a while, and each of us put our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>317]</a></span>
various powers to the proof.&rdquo; This proposal pleased
the Wrestler and the Pearl-shooter, who accompanied
the Pundit to his house.</p>

<p>Now, in the kitchen there was an enormous cauldron
of iron, so heavy that five-and-twenty men could hardly
move it; and in the dead of night the Wrestler, to prove
his power, got up from the veranda where he was sleeping,
and as quietly as possible lifted this great cauldron
on his shoulders and carried it down to the river, where
he waded with it into the deepest part of the water, and
there buried it. After having accomplished this feat,
he returned to the Pundit&rsquo;s house as quietly as he had
left it, and, rolling himself up in his blanket, fell fast
asleep. But though he had come never so softly, the
Pundit&rsquo;s wife heard him, and waking her husband, she
said, &ldquo;I hear footsteps as of people creeping quietly
about and not wishing to be heard, and but a little while
ago I noticed the same thing; perhaps there are thieves
in the house; let us go and see: it is strange they should
choose such a bright moonlight night.&rdquo; And they both
got up quickly and walked round the house. They
found nothing, however, out of order, nor any signs of
anything having been touched or disarranged, until they
came to the kitchen. And, indeed, at first they thought
all was as they left it there, when, just as they were
going away, the Pundit&rsquo;s wife cried out to him, &ldquo;Why,
what has become of the great cauldron? I never
thought of looking to see if that was safe; for it did not
seem possible that it could have been moved.&rdquo; And
they both looked inside the house and outside, but the
cauldron was nowhere to be seen. At last, however,
they discovered deep footprints in the sand close to the
kitchen door, as of some one who had been carrying a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>318]</a></span>
very heavy weight, and these they traced down to the
river-side.</p>

<p>Then the Pundit said, &ldquo;Some one immensely strong
has evidently done this, for here are the footprints of
one man only; and he must have buried the cauldron
in the water, for, see, there is no continuation of the
footprints on the other side. I wonder who can have
done it? Let us go and see that our two guests are
asleep; perhaps the Wrestler played us this trick to
prove his great strength.&rdquo; And with his wife he went
into the veranda, where the Pearl-shooter and the
Wrestler lay rolled up in their blankets, fast asleep.
First, they looked at the Pearl-shooter; but on seeing
him the Pundit shook his head, saying, &ldquo;No, he certainly
has not done this thing.&rdquo; They then looked at
the Wrestler, and the cunning Pundit licked the skin
of the sleeping man, and, turning to his wife, whispered,
&ldquo;This is assuredly the man who stole the cauldron and
put it in the river, for he must have been but lately up
to his neck in fresh water, since there is no taste of salt
on his skin from his foot even to his shoulders. To-morrow
I will surprise him by showing him I know
this.&rdquo; And so saying, the Pundit crept back into the
house, followed by his wife.</p>

<p>Next morning early, as soon as it was light, the
Pearl-shooter and the Wrestler were accosted by their
host, who said to them, &ldquo;Let us go down to the river
and have a wash, for I cannot offer you a bath, since
the great cauldron, in which we generally bathe, has
been mysteriously carried away this very night.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Where can it have gone?&rdquo; said the Wrestler. &ldquo;Ah,
where indeed?&rdquo; answered the Pundit; and he led them
down to where the cauldron had been put into the river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>319]</a></span>
by the Wrestler the night before, and wading about in
the water until he found it, pointed it out to him, saying,
&ldquo;See, friend, how far this cauldron traveled!&rdquo;
The Wrestler was much surprised to find that the Pundit
knew where the cauldron was hidden, and said,
&ldquo;Who can have put it there?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo;
answered the Pundit; &ldquo;why, I think it was you!&rdquo;
And then he related how his wife had heard footsteps,
and, being afraid of thieves, had awakened him the
night before, and how they had discovered that the
cauldron was missing, and traced it down to the river-side;
and then how he had found out that the Wrestler
had just before been into the water up to his neck.
The Wrestler and the Pearl-shooter were both much
astonished at the Pundit&rsquo;s wisdom in having found this
out; and the Pearl-shooter said to himself, &ldquo;Both
these men are certainly more clever than I.&rdquo; Then
the three clever men returned to the house, and were
very happy and joyful, and amused themselves laughing
and talking all the rest of the day; and when evening
came, the Pundit said to the Wrestler, &ldquo;Let us to-night
forego all meagre fare and have a royal feast;
friend Strongman, pray you go and catch the fattest of
those goats that we see upon the hills yonder, and we
will cook it for our dinner.&rdquo; The Wrestler assented,
and ran on and on until he reached the flock of goats
browsing upon the hill-side. Now, just at that moment
a wicked little Demon came by that way, and on
seeing the Wrestler looking at the goats (to see which
seemed the finest to take home to dinner), he thought
to himself, &ldquo;If I can make him choose me, and take
me home with him for his dinner, I shall be able to
play him and his friends some fine tricks.&rdquo; So, quick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>320]</a></span>
as thought, he changed himself into a very handsome
goat, and when the Wrestler saw this one goat, so
much taller and finer and fatter than all the rest, he ran
and caught hold of him and tucked him under his arm,
to carry him home for dinner. The goat kicked and
kicked and jumped about, and tried to butt more
fiercely than the Wrestler had ever known any mortal
goat do before, but still he held him tight and brought
him in triumph to the Pundit&rsquo;s door. The Pundit
heard him coming and ran out to meet him; but when
he saw the goat, he started back quite frightened, for
the Wrestler was holding it so tight that its eyes were
almost starting out of its head, and they were fiery and
evil-looking and burning like two living coals, and the
Pundit saw at once that it was a Demon, and no goat,
that his friend held; then he thought quickly, &ldquo;If I
appear to be frightened, this cruel Demon will get into
the house and devour us all; I must endeavor to intimidate
him.&rdquo; So, in a bold voice, he cried, &ldquo;O Wrestler!
Wrestler! foolish friend! what have you done?
We asked you to fetch a fat goat for our dinner, and
here you have only brought one wretched little Demon.
If you could not find goats, while you were about it
you might as well have brought more Demons, for we
are hungry people. My children are each accustomed
to eat one Demon a day, and my wife eats three, and I
myself eat twelve, and here you have only brought one
between us all! What are we to do?&rdquo; At hearing
these reproaches, the Wrestler was so much astonished
that he dropped the Demon-goat, who, for his
part, was so frightened at the Pundit&rsquo;s words, that he
came crawling along quite humbly upon his knees,
saying, &ldquo;Oh, sir, do not eat me, do not eat me, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>321]</a></span>
will give you anything you like in the world. Only
let me go, and I will fetch you mountains of treasure,
rubies and diamonds, and gold and precious stones beyond
all count. Do not eat me; only let me go!&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the Pundit; &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;ll do;
you&rsquo;ll just go away and never return: we are very hungry;
we do not want gold and precious stones, but we
want a good dinner; we must certainly eat you.&rdquo;
The Demon thought all that the Pundit said must be
true, he spoke so fearlessly and naturally. So he only
repeated more earnestly, &ldquo;Only let me go; I promise
you to return and bring you all the riches that you
could desire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Pundit was too wise to seem glad; but he said
sternly, &ldquo;Very well, you may go; but unless you return
quickly and bring the treasure you promise, be you
in the uttermost part of the earth, we will find you
and eat you, for we are more powerful than you and
all your fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Demon, who had just experienced how much
stronger the Wrestler was than ordinary men, and then
heard from the Pundit&rsquo;s own lips of his love for eating
Demons, thought himself exceedingly lucky to have
escaped their clutches so easily; and returning to his
own land, he fetched from the Demons&rsquo; storehouse a
vast amount of precious things, with which he was
flying away with all speed (in order to pay his debt
and avoid being afterward hunted and eaten), when
several of his comrades caught hold of him, and in angry
tones asked where he was carrying away so much
of their treasure. The Demon answered, &ldquo;I take it
to save my life; for whilst wandering round the world
I was caught by terrible creatures, more dreadful than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>322]</a></span>
the sons of men, and they threaten to eat me unless I
bring the treasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should like to see these dreadful creatures,&rdquo;
answered they, &ldquo;for we never before heard of mortals
who devoured Demons.&rdquo; To which he replied, &ldquo;These
are not ordinary mortals; I tell you they are the
fiercest creatures I ever saw, and would devour our
Rajah, himself, did they get the chance; one of them
said that he daily ate twelve Demons, that his wife ate
three, and each of his children one.&rdquo; At hearing this
they consented to let him go for the time; but the
Demon Rajah commanded him to return with all speed
next day, that the matter might be further discussed
in solemn council.</p>

<p>When, after three days&rsquo; absence, the Demon returned
to the Pundit&rsquo;s house with the treasure, the Pundit
angrily said to him, &ldquo;Why have you been so long
away? You promised to return as soon as possible.&rdquo;
He answered, &ldquo;All my fellow-Demons detained me,
and would hardly let me go, they were so angry at my
bringing you so much treasure; and though I told them
how great and powerful you are, they would not believe
me, but will, as soon as I return, judge me in
solemn council for serving you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is your
solemn council held?&rdquo; asked the Pundit. &ldquo;Oh, very
far, far away,&rdquo; answered the Demon, &ldquo;in the depths
of the jungle, where our Rajah daily holds his court.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I and my friends should like to see that place, and
your Rajah and all his court,&rdquo; said the Pundit; &ldquo;you
must take us with you when you go, for we have absolute
mastery over all Demons, even over their Rajah
himself, and unless you do as we command we shall be
very angry.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the Demon, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>323]</a></span>
he felt quite frightened at the Pundit&rsquo;s fierce words;
&ldquo;mount on my back and I&rsquo;ll take you there.&rdquo; So the
Pundit, the Wrestler and the Pearl-shooter all mounted
the Demon, and he flew away with them, on, on, on,
as fast as wings could cut the air, till they reached the
great jungle where the durbar<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> was to be held, and
there he placed them all on the top of a high tree just
over the Demon Rajah&rsquo;s throne. In a few minutes the
Pearl-shooter, the Wrestler and the Pundit heard a
rushing noise, and thousands and thousands of Demons
filled the place, covering the ground as far as the eye
could reach, and thronging chiefly round the Rajah&rsquo;s
throne; but they did not notice the men in the tree
above them. Then the Rajah ordered that the Demon
who had taken of their treasure to give to mortals
should be brought to judgment; and when they had
dragged the culprit into the midst of them, they accused
him, and having proved him guilty, would have
punished him; but he defended himself stoutly, saying,
&ldquo;Noble Rajah, those who forced me to fetch them
treasure were no ordinary mortals, but great and terrible;
they said they ate many Demons; the man ate
twelve a day, his wife ate three, and each of his children
one. He said, moreover, that he and his friends
were more powerful than us all, and ruled your
majesty as absolutely as we are ruled by you.&rdquo; The
Demon Rajah answered, &ldquo;Let us see these great people
of whom you speak, and we will believe you; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
At this moment the tree upon which the Pundit,
the Pearl-shooter and the Wrestler were, broke,
and down they all tumbled&mdash;first, the Wrestler, then
the Pearl-shooter, and lastly the Pundit&mdash;upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>324]</a></span>
head of the Demon Rajah as he sat in judgment.
They seemed to have come down from the sky, so suddenly
did they appear, and, being very much alarmed
at their awkward position determined to take the
aggressive. So the Wrestler kicked and hugged and
beat the Rajah with all his might and main, and the
Pearl-shooter did likewise, while the Pundit, who was
perched up a little higher than either of the others,
cried, &ldquo;So be it, so be it. We will eat him first for
dinner, and afterward we will eat all the other Demons.&rdquo;
The Demons hearing this, one and all flew
away from the confusion and left their Rajah to his
fate; while he cried, &ldquo;Oh spare me! spare me! I see
it is all true; only let me go, and I will give you as
much treasure as you like.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the Pundit;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t listen to him, friends; we will eat him for dinner.&rdquo;
And the Wrestler and the Pearl-shooter kicked
and beat him harder than before. Then the Demon
cried again, &ldquo;Let me go! let me go!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo;
they answered; and they chastised him vigorously for
the space of an hour, until, at last, fearing they should
get tired, the Pundit said, &ldquo;The treasure would be no
use to us here in the jungle; but if you brought us a
very great deal to our own house, we might give up
eating you for dinner to-day; you must, however, give
us great compensation, for we are all very hungry.&rdquo;
To this the Demon Rajah gladly agreed, and, calling
together his scattered subjects, ordered them to take
the three valiant men home again and convey the
treasure to the Pundit&rsquo;s house. The little Demons
obeyed his orders with much fear and trembling, but
they were very willing to do their best to get the Pundit,
the Pearl-shooter and the Wrestler out of Demon-land,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>325]</a></span>
and they, for their parts, were no less anxious to go.
When they got home, the Pundit said, &ldquo;You shall not
go until the engagement is fulfilled.&rdquo; Instantly Demons
without number filled the house with riches, and when
they had accomplished their task, they all flew away,
fearing greatly the terrible Pundit and his friends, who
talked of eating Demons as men would eat almonds
and raisins. So, by never showing that he was afraid,
this brave Pundit saved his family from being eaten by
these Demons, and also got a vast amount of treasure.
Then he divided it into three equal portions: a third
he gave to the Wrestler, a third he gave to the Pearl-shooter,
and a third he kept himself; after which he
sent his friends, with many kindly words, back to their
own homes. So the Pearl-shooter returned to his
house laden with gold and jewels of priceless worth;
and when he got there, he called his wife and gave
them to her, saying, &ldquo;I have been a far journey and
brought back all these treasures for you, and I have
learnt that your words were true, since in the world
there are cleverer men than I; for mine is a cleverness
that profits not, and but for a Pundit and a Wrestler, I
should not have gained these riches. I will shoot
the pearl from your nose-ring no more.&rdquo; And he
never did.</p>

<h2>XXIV.<br />
<br />
<i>THE ALLIGATOR AND THE JACKAL.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> HUNGRY JACKAL once went down to the
river-side in search of little crabs, bits of fish
and whatever else he could find for his dinner. Now
it chanced that in this river there lived a great big Alligator,
who, being also very hungry, would have been
extremely glad to eat the Jackal.</p>

<p>The Jackal ran up and down, here and there, but for
a long time could find nothing to eat. At last, close
to where the Alligator was lying among some tall bulrushes
under the clear, shallow water, he saw a little
crab sidling along as fast as his legs could carry him.
The Jackal was so hungry that when he saw this he
poked his paw into the water to try and catch the crab,
when snap! the old Alligator caught hold of him.
&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; thought the Jackal to himself, &ldquo;what can I
do? This great big Alligator has caught my paw in his
mouth, and in another minute he will drag me down
by it under the water and kill me. My only chance is
to make him think he has made a mistake.&rdquo; So he
called out in a cheerful voice, &ldquo;Clever Alligator, clever
Alligator, to catch hold of a bulrush root instead of my
paw! I hope you find it very tender.&rdquo; The Alligator,
who was so buried among the bulrushes that he could
hardly see, thought, on hearing this, &ldquo;Dear me, how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>327]</a></span>
tiresome! I fancied I had caught hold of the Jackal&rsquo;s
paw; but there he is, calling out in a cheerful voice.
I suppose I must have seized a bulrush root instead,
as he says;&rdquo; and he let the Jackal go.</p>

<p>The Jackal ran away as fast as he could, crying,
&ldquo;O wise Alligator, wise Alligator! So you let me go
again!&rdquo; Then the Alligator was very much vexed,
but the Jackal had run away too far to be caught.
Next day the Jackal returned to the river-side to get his
dinner, as before; but because he was very much afraid
of the Alligator he called out, &ldquo;Whenever I go to look
for my dinner, I see the nice little crabs peeping up
through the mud; then I catch them and eat them. I
wish I could see one now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Alligator, who was buried in the mud at the
bottom of the river, heard every word. So he popped
the little point of his snout above it, thinking, &ldquo;If I do
but just show the tip of my nose, the Jackal will take
me for a crab and put in his paw to catch me, and as
soon as ever he does I&rsquo;ll gobble him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But no sooner did the Jackal see the little tip of the
Alligator&rsquo;s nose than he called out, &ldquo;Aha, my friend!
there you are. No dinner for me in this part of the
river, then, I think.&rdquo; And so saying he ran farther
on and fished for his dinner a long way from that
place. The Alligator was very angry at missing his
prey a second time, and determined not to let him
escape again.</p>

<p>So on the following day, when his little tormentor
returned to the water-side, the Alligator hid himself
close to the bank, in order to catch him if he could.
Now the Jackal was rather afraid going near the river,
for he thought, &ldquo;Perhaps this Alligator will catch me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>328]</a></span>
to-day.&rdquo; But yet, being hungry, he did not wish to go
without his dinner; so to make all as safe as he could,
he cried, &ldquo;Where are all the little crabs gone? There
is not one here and I am so hungry; and generally,
even when they are under water, one can see them
going bubble, bubble, bubble, and all the little bubbles
go pop! pop! pop!&rdquo; On hearing this the Alligator,
who was buried in the mud under the river-bank,
thought, &ldquo;I will pretend to be a little crab.&rdquo; And he
began to blow, &ldquo;Puff, puff, puff! Bubble, bubble, bubble!&rdquo;
and all the great big bubbles rushed to the
surface of the river and burst there, and the waters
eddied round and round like a whirlpool; and there
was such a commotion when the huge monster began
to blow bubbles in this way that the Jackal saw very
well who must be there, and he ran away as fast as he
could, saying, &ldquo;Thank you, kind Alligator, thank you;
thank you! Indeed I would not have come here had I
known you were so close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This enraged the Alligator extremely; it made him
quite cross to think of being so often deceived by a
little Jackal, and he said to himself, &ldquo;I will be taken
in no more. Next time I will be very cunning.&rdquo; So
for a long time he waited and waited for the Jackal to
return to the river-side; but the Jackal did not come,
for he had thought to himself, &ldquo;If matters go on in this
way, I shall some day be caught and eaten by the
wicked old Alligator. I had better content myself
with living on wild figs,&rdquo; and he went no more near
the river, but stayed in the jungles and ate wild figs,
and roots which he dug up with his paws.</p>

<p>When the Alligator found this out, he determined to
try and catch the Jackal on land; so, going under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>329]</a></span>
largest of wild fig trees, where the ground was covered
with the fallen fruit, he collected a quantity of it together,
and, burying himself under the great heap,
waited for the Jackal to appear. But no sooner did
the cunning little animal see this great heap of wild figs
all collected together, than he thought, &ldquo;That looks
very like my friend the Alligator.&rdquo; And to discover if
it was so or not, he called out, &ldquo;The juicy little wild
figs I love to eat always tumble down from the tree,
and roll here and there as the wind drives them; but
this great heap of figs is quite still; these cannot be
good figs; I will not eat any of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo;
thought the Alligator, &ldquo;is that all? How suspicious
this Jackal is! I will make the figs roll about a little
then, and when he sees that he will doubtless come
and eat them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the great beast shook himself, and all the heap of
little figs went roll, roll, roll&mdash;some a mile this way,
some a mile that, farther than they had ever rolled before
or than the most blustering wind could have driven
them.</p>

<p>Seeing this, the Jackal scampered away, saying, &ldquo;I
am so much obliged to you, Alligator, for letting me
know you are there, for indeed I should hardly have
guessed it. You were so buried under that heap of
figs.&rdquo; The Alligator, hearing this, was so angry that
he ran after the Jackal, but the latter ran very, very fast
away, too quickly to be caught.</p>

<p>Then the Alligator said to himself, &ldquo;I will not allow
that little wretch to make fun of me another time and
then run away out of reach; I will show him that I
can be more cunning than he fancies.&rdquo; And early the
next morning he crawled as fast as he could to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>330]</a></span>
Jackal&rsquo;s den (which was a hole in the side of a hill)
and crept into it, and hid himself, waiting for the Jackal,
who was out, to return home. But when the Jackal got
near the place, he looked about him and thought, &ldquo;Dear
me! the ground looks as if some heavy creature had
been walking over it, and here are great clods of earth
knocked down from each side of the door of my den,
as if a very big animal had been trying to squeeze himself
through it. I certainly will not go inside until I
know that all is safe there.&rdquo; So he called out, &ldquo;Little
house, pretty house, my sweet little house, why do you
not give an answer when I call? If I come, and all is
safe and right, you always call out to me. Is anything
wrong, that you do not speak?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Alligator, who was inside, thought, &ldquo;If that
is the case I had better call out, that he may fancy all
is right in his house.&rdquo; And in as gentle a voice as he
could, he said, &ldquo;Sweet little Jackal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At hearing these words the Jackal felt quite frightened,
and thought to himself, &ldquo;So the dreadful old Alligator
is there. I must try to kill him if I can, for if I do not
he will certainly catch and kill me some day.&rdquo; He
therefore answered, &ldquo;Thank you, my dear little house.
I like to hear your pretty voice. I am coming in in a
minute, but first I must collect firewood to cook my
dinner.&rdquo; And he ran as fast as he could, and dragged
all the dry branches and bits of stick he could find
close up to the mouth of the den. Meantime, the
Alligator inside kept as quiet as a mouse, but he could
not help laughing a little to himself, as he thought, &ldquo;So
I have deceived this tiresome little Jackal at last. In a
few minutes he will run in here, and then won&rsquo;t I snap
him up!&rdquo; When the Jackal had gathered together all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>331]</a></span>
the sticks he could find and put them round the mouth
of his den, he set them on fire and pushed them as far
into it as possible. There was such a quantity of them
that they soon blazed up into a great fire, and the smoke
and flames filled the den and smothered the wicked old
Alligator and burnt him to death, while the little Jackal
ran up and down outside, dancing for joy and singing&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you like my house, my friend? Is it nice
and warm? Ding-dong! ding-dong! The Alligator
is dying! ding-dong, ding-dong! He will trouble me
no more. I have defeated my enemy! Ring-a-ting!
ding-a-ting! ding-ding-dong!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>NOTES ON THE NARRATOR&rsquo;S NARRATIVE.</h2>


<h3><a name="notea" id="notea"></a>NOTE A.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE battle of Kirkee was the turning-point in the last Mahratta
war, which sealed the fate of the Peishwa&rsquo;s dynasty and transferred
the Deccan to British rule, and is naturally, in that part of
India, still regarded, by all whose recollections go back to those
days, as the one great event of modern history.</p>

<p>When the collector of these tales was in India, the house temporarily
occupied by the Governor of Bombay overlooked the field of
battle, and among those who came to see the Governor on business
or pleasure were some&mdash;natives as well as Europeans&mdash;to whom the
events of half a century ago were matters of living memory.</p>

<p>Old soldiers would tell how the fidelity of the native Sepoys resisted
all the bribes and threats of Bajee Row Peishwa, the absolute
Brahmin ruler of Poona, and thus, while the Peishwa hoped to effect
his purpose by treachery, enabled Mr. Mountstuart Elphinstone to
defer open hostilities&mdash;a matter of vital importance to the operations
of Lord Hastings on the other side of India, in preparing for his
great campaign against the Pindarees.</p>

<p>The veterans would recount all the romantic incidents of the struggle
which followed&mdash;how the &ldquo;old Toughs&rdquo; (now H.&nbsp;M.&rsquo;s 103d
Regiment), the only European corps within reach, when at last
slipped from the leash at Panwell, marched seventy-two miles
straight up over the ghauts to Poona, with only a single three-hours&rsquo;
halt en route; how they closed up their ranks of travel-soiled warriors
and entered the British lines with band playing and colors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>334]</a></span>
flying; and how not a straggler dropped behind, &ldquo;for all knew that
there must be a battle soon.&rdquo; Their arrival was the signal for the
Peishwa to throw off the mask, and, as the British Residency was
untenable, the English troops moved out to take up a safer position
at Kirkee, about three miles from the city of Poona; and as they
marched they saw all the houses of the Resident and his suite fired
by the enemy, who swarmed out of the city. As they formed in line
of battle, they anxiously watched the native regiments coming up on
their flank from Dapoorie, for that was the moment for successful
treachery if the native soldiers were untrue! Not a Sepoy, however,
in the British ranks wavered, though before the junction was
complete a cloud of Mahratta cavalry poured down upon them,
dashed through the opening left between the two lines, enveloped
either flank of the little army, and attacked the European regiment
in the rear. Then, as a last resource, the European regiment faced
about their second rank, and kept up such a steady rolling fire to
front and rear at the same time that but few of the eager horsemen
ever came within spear&rsquo;s length of the British bayonets.</p>

<p>One of the most touching recollections of those times attracted our
notice almost the last day we spent at Kirkee. An old chief, Jadowrow
of Malagaom, had come to take leave of the departing Governor.
He was head of one of the oldest Mahratta families, for his ancestors
were famous as a very ancient royal house before the Mohammedans
invaded the Deccan. The old man had borne arms as a youthful
commander of horse when the great Duke was at Poona in 1802, just
before the battle of Assaye, had been greatly distinguished for his
gallantry in the battle of Kirkee, so fatal to his race, and had followed
the fortunes of the Peishwa to the last. Disdaining to make
separate terms for himself with the English conqueror, he remained
one of the few thoroughly faithful to his sovereign&mdash;not from love,
for he loved not Bajee Row, but &ldquo;because he had eaten his salt&rdquo;&mdash;and
only after the Peishwa&rsquo;s surrender returned to his old castle near
Poona. There for many years he lived, hunting and hawking over
his diminished acres, and greatly respected as a model of a gallant
and honorable old chief; but he could never be persuaded to revisit
the capital of the Mahrattas after its occupation by the English.
&ldquo;He had no child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and his race would die with him.&rdquo;
At last, as years rolled on, an only son was born to him; and then,
touched by some unexpected act of liberality on the part of the
British government which would secure his ancestral estate to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>335]</a></span>
child of his old age, he resolved to go to Poona, and visited the
Governor, whose temporary residence happened to overlook the
battle-field of Kirkee. He gazed long and wistfully from the drawing-room
windows and said, &ldquo;This place is much changed since I
was here last, fifty years ago. It was here the battle was fought, and
it was from near this very spot that we charged down that slope on
the English line as it formed beyond that brook. I never thought to
have seen this place again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost every hill, fort, and every large village round Poona, has
some tradition, not only of the days of Alumgeer, Sivajee and of
early Mahratta history, but of the campaigns of Wellesley in 1802
and of the last great struggle in 1817-18.</p>

<h3><a name="noteb" id="noteb"></a>NOTE B.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna&rsquo;s</span> remarks on the contrast between the present dearth and
the &ldquo;good old times&rdquo; of cheap bread, when the rupee went so much
further than it does now, are very characteristic. The complaint,
too, is very universal, and is to be heard in the household of public
functionaries, the highest as well as the lowest, in every grade of
native society, and more or less in all parts of India.</p>

<p>The Narrator&rsquo;s notion, that &ldquo;The English fixed the rupee at sixteen
annas,&rdquo; is another specimen of a very widespread Indian popular
delusion. The rupee always consisted of sixteen annas, for the anna
means only the sixteenth part of anything, but to the poor the great
matter for consideration in all questions of currency is the quantity
of small change they can get for the coin in which their wages are
paid. Formerly this used to fluctuate with the price of copper, and
the quantity of copper change which a silver rupee would fetch varied
as copper was cheap or dear, and was always greatest when the
copper currency was most debased. The English introduced all
over India a uniform currency of copper as well as of silver, and none
of course were greater gainers in the long run by this uniformity than
the very poor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> unable, at present, to give either the native words or music
for this curious little Calicut song. The second part is probably of
Portuguese origin, or it may have been derived from the Syrian
Christians, who have been settled on that coast since the earliest
ages.</p>

<p>The English translation of the words, as explained to me by Anna,
is as follows:</p>

<p class="hang">1. Very far went the ship, in the dark, up and down, up and down.
There was very little sky; the sailors couldn&rsquo;t see anything;
rain was coming.</p>

<p class="hang">2. Now darkness, lightning and very little rain; but big flashes,
two yards long, that looked as if they fell into the sea.</p>

<p class="hang">3. On the third day the captain looks out for land, shading his eyes
with his hand. There may be land. The sailors say to him,
&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; He answers, &ldquo;Far off is the jungle,
and, swinging in a tree, is an old monkey, with two little
monkeys in her arms. We must be nearing land.&rdquo;</p>

do you see?&rdquo; He answers, &ldquo;On the shore there walks a
pretty little maiden, with a chattee on her head; she skips
and runs, and dances as she goes. We must be nearing
land.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="hang">5. The storm begins to rage again, and hides the land: at last it

<p>It was, she said, very pretty, being the song of the little wife as she
decks herself in her jewels to please her husband when he comes

their father&rsquo;s dinner, would be nothing unusual in the household of a

precaution he can take against poison to eat nothing but what has
been prepared by his wife or daughter, or under their eye in his own

more favored wife to share her throne, however difficult to understand
in the West, is very characteristic of Oriental life. In Indian
households of the highest rank it would not be difficult to find examples
of several wives living amicably together, as described in some
of these stories; but the contrary result, as depicted in this story of
Surya Bai and others, is far more common, for as a general rule
human nature is too strong for custom, and under an external serenity
bitter jealousies exist between the several wives of a royal
Hindoo household, which are a constant source of misery and crime.
Among the curious changes of opinion which are observable of late
years in the Indian empire, none is more remarkable than the conviction,
now frequently expressed by the warmest supporters of native
governments at native courts, that the toleration of polygamy is one
of their most serious dangers, the removal of which is of vital importance
to the safety of any Indian dynasty, and indeed to the permanence
of any Indian family of rank.</p>


<h3><a name="note04" id="note04"></a>THE WANDERINGS OF VICRAM MAHARAJAH.</h3>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_131">131</a>.&mdash;The Dipmal, or Tower of Lights, is an essential feature
in every large Hindoo temple. It is often of great height, and
furnished with niches or brackets, each of which holds a lamp on
festivals, especially on that of the Dewali, the feast of lamps celebrated
in the autumn in honor of the Hindoo goddess Bowani or
Kali, who was formerly propitiated on that occasion by human
sacrifices.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_132">132</a>.&mdash;The story of Vicram&rsquo;s act of devotion is thoroughly
Hindoo. It is difficult to understand the universal prevalence and
strength of the conviction among Hindoos that the particular god of
their adoration can be prevailed on, by importunity or self-devotion,
to reveal to his worshiper some act, generally ascetic or sacrificial,
the performance of which will insure to the devotee the realization
of the object of his wishes. The act of devotion and the object of
the devotee are both often very trivial; but occasionally we are
startled by hearing of some deed of horror, a human sacrifice or deliberate
act of self-immolation, which is quite unaccountable to those
who are not aware that it is only a somewhat extreme manifestation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>340]</a></span>
of a belief which still influences the daily conduct of the great majority
of the Hindoos.</p>

<p>And even those who have known the Hindoos long and intimately
frequently fail to recognize the extent to which this belief influences
the ethics of common life and action in India. To quote an instance
from well-known history, there are few acts regarding which a European
traveler would expect the verdict of all mankind to be more
generally condemnatory than the murder of Afzul Khan, the general
of the Imperial Delhi army, by Sivajee, the founder of the Mahratta
empire. Sivajee, according to the well-known story, had invited his
victim to an amicable conference, and there stabbed him with a wag
nuck<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> as they embraced at their first meeting. It was a deed of such
deliberate and cruel treachery that it could find few defenders in
Europe, even among the wildest advocates of political assassination.
A European is consequently little prepared to find it regarded by
Mahrattas generally as a most commendable act of devotion. The
Hindoo conscience condemns murder and treachery as emphatically
as the European; but this act, as viewed by the old-fashioned Mahratta,
was a sacrifice prescribed by direct revelation of the terrible
goddess Bowani to her faithful devotee. It was therefore highly
meritorious, and the beautiful Genoese blade which Sivajee always
wore, and with which his victim was finally despatched, was, down to
our own days, provided with a little temple of its own in the palace
of his descendants, and annually worshiped by them and their household&mdash;not
as a mere act of veneration for their ancestor&rsquo;s trusty
sword, but because it was the chosen instrument of a great sacrifice,
and &ldquo;no doubt,&rdquo; as the attendant who watched it used to say, &ldquo;some
of the spirit of Bowani,&rdquo; whose name it bore, &ldquo;must still reside
in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An attentive observer will notice in the daily life of those around
him in India constant instances of this belief in the efficacy of acts of
devotion and sacrifice to alter even the decrees of Fate. It is one of
the many incentives to the long pilgrimages which form such a universal
feature in Hindoo life, and the records of the courts of justice
and the Indian newspapers constantly afford traces of its prevalence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>341]</a></span>
in cases of attempted suttee and other acts of self-immolation, or even
of human sacrifice, such as are above alluded to. It must be remembered
that Hindoo sacrifice has nothing but the name in common
with the sacrifices which are a distinctive part of the religion of every
Semitic race. Many a difficulty which besets the Hindoo inquirer
after truth would be avoided if this essential distinction were always
known or remembered.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_136">136</a>.&mdash;This belief in the omnipotence of &ldquo;Muntrs,&rdquo; or certain
verbal formulas, properly pronounced by one to whom they have been
authoritatively communicated, is closely allied to, and quite as universal
as, the belief in the efficacy of sacrificial acts of devotion. In
every nation throughout India, whatever may be the variations of
creed or caste usage, it is a general article of belief, accepted by the
vast majority of every class and caste of Hindoos, that there is a form
of words (or Muntr) which, to be efficacious, can be only orally transmitted,
but which, when so communicated by one of the &ldquo;twice-born,&rdquo;
has absolutely unlimited power over all things visible or
invisible, extending even to compelling the obedience of the gods
and of Fate itself. Of course it is rather dangerous, even for the
wisest, to meddle with such potent influences, and the attempt is
usually confined to the affairs of common life; but of the absolute
omnipotence of &ldquo;Muntrs&rdquo; few ordinary un-Europeanized Hindoos
entertain any doubt, and there is hardly any part of their belief which
exercises such an all-pervading and potent influence in their daily
life, though that influence is often but little understood by Europeans.</p>

<p>The classical reader will remember many allusions to a similar
belief as a part of the creeds imported from the East, which were
fashionable under the Empire at Rome. There is much curious information
on the subject of the earliest-known Hindoo Muntrs in the
<i>Aitareya Brahmana</i> of the learned Dr. Haug, the only European who
ever witnessed the whole process of a Hindoo sacrifice. The reader
who is curious on such matters will do well to consult the recently-published
work of Professor Max M&uuml;ller, which might, without exaggeration,
be described as a storehouse of new facts connected with
the religion and literature of the East, rather than by its modest title
of <i>Chips from a German Workshop</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="note05" id="note05"></a>HOW THE SUN, THE MOON AND THE WIND WENT

<p>Page <a href="#Page_194">194</a>.&mdash;I have not ventured to alter the traditional mode of the
Moon&rsquo;s conveyance of dinner to her mother the Star, though it must,
I fear, seriously impair the value of the story as a moral lesson in the
eyes of all instructors of youth.</p>

<h3><a name="note06" id="note06"></a>SINGH RAJAH AND THE CUNNING LITTLE JACKALS.</h3>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_198">198</a>.&mdash;This story is substantially the same as one well-known
to readers of Pilpai&rsquo;s <i>Fables</i>. The chorus of the Jackals&rsquo; song of
triumph is an imitation of their nocturnal howl.</p>


<h3><a name="note07" id="note07"></a>THE JACKAL, THE BARBER AND THE BRAHMIN.</h3>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_203">203</a>.&mdash;The touch of the poor outcast Mahars would be pollution
to a Hindoo of any but the lowest caste; hence their ready obedience
to the Jackal&rsquo;s exhortation not to touch him.</p>

<p>The offerings of rice, flowers, a chicken, &amp;c., and the pouring water
over the idol, are parts of the regular daily observance in every village
temple.</p>


<h3><a name="note08" id="note08"></a>MUCHIE LAL.</h3>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_265">265</a>.&mdash;The popular belief in stories of this kind, where the
Cobra becomes the companion of human beings, is greatly strengthened
by the instances which occasionally occur when particular persons,
sometimes children or idiots, possess the power to handle the
deadly reptiles without receiving any injury from them. How much
is due merely to gentleness of touch and fearlessness, and how much
to any personal peculiarity which pleases the senses of the snake, it
is difficult to say, for the instances, though not few and perfectly well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>343]</a></span>
authenticated, are sufficiently rare to be popularly regarded as miraculous.</p>

<p>In one case, which occurred in the country west of Poona not long
after our conquest of the Deccan, a Brahmin boy could, without the
aid of music or anything but his own voice, attract to himself and
handle with impunity all the snakes which might be within hearing
in any thicket or dry stone wall, such as in that country is their favorite
refuge. So great was the popular excitement regarding him,
under the belief that he was an incarnation of some divinity, that the
magistrate of Poona took note of his proceedings, and becoming uneasy
as to the political turn the excitement regarding the boy might
take, reported regularly to government the growth of the crowds who
pressed to see the marvel and to offer gifts to the child and his
parents! The poor boy, however, was at last bitten by one of the
reptiles and died, and the wonder ceased.</p>


<h3><a name="note09" id="note09"></a>CHUNDUN RAJAH.</h3>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_274">274</a>.&mdash;There are innumerable popular superstitions regarding
the powers which can be conveyed in a charmed necklace; and it is
a common belief that good and bad fortune, and life itself, can be
made to depend on its not being removed from the wearer&rsquo;s neck.</p>


<h3><a name="note10" id="note10"></a>CHANDRA&rsquo;S VENGEANCE.</h3>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_292">292</a>.&mdash;The picture of the childless wife setting forth to seek
Mahdeo, and resolving not to return till she has seen him, is one
which would find a parallel in some of the persons composing almost
every group of pilgrims who resort to the great shrines of Hindostan.
Any one who has an opportunity of quietly questioning the members
of such an assemblage will find that, besides the miscellaneous crowd
of idlers, there are usually specimens of two classes of very earnest
devotees. The one class is intent on the performance of some act
of ascetic devotion, the object of which is to win the favor of the
divinity, or to fulfill a vow for a favor already granted. The other
class is seeking &ldquo;to see the divinity,&rdquo; and expecting the revelation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>344]</a></span>
under one or other of the terrible forms of the Hindoo Pantheon.
There are few things more pathetic than to hear one of this class recount
the wanderings and sufferings of his past search, or the journeys
he has before him, which are too often prolonged till death puts
an end to the wanderer and his pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_294">294</a>.&mdash;The &ldquo;fire which does not burn&rdquo; is everywhere in
India one of the attributes of Mahdeo.</p>

<p>In many parts of the Deccan are to be found shrines consecrated
to one of the local gods, who has been Brahminically recognized as a
local manifestation of Mahdeo, where the annual festival of the
divinity was, within the last few years, kept by lighting huge fires,
through which devotees ran or jumped, attributing their escape from
burning to the interposition of Mahdeo. Except in a few remote
villages, this custom, which sometimes led to serious accidents, has
in British territory been stopped by the police.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_298">298</a>.&mdash;This story of the wonderful child who was found floating
in a box on a river is to be heard, with more or less picturesque
local variations, on the banks of every large river in India. Almost
every old village in Sind has a local tradition of this kind.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_305">305</a>.&mdash;Most households in Calcutta can furnish recollections
of depredations by birds, at their nest-building season, similar to that
of the Ranee&rsquo;s bangles by the Eagles in this story. But the object
of the theft is generally more prosaic. I have known gold rings so
taken, but the plunder is more frequently a lady&rsquo;s cuff or collar, or a
piece of lace; and the plunderers are crows, and sometimes, but very
rarely, a kite.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_313">313</a>.&mdash;Purwaris, or outcasts, who are not suffered to live
within the quarter inhabited by the higher castes, are very numerous
in Southern India, and a legend similar to this one is a frequent
popular explanation of their being in excess as compared with other
classes of the population.</p>


<h3><a name="note11" id="note11"></a>HOW THE THREE CLEVER MEN OUTWITTED THE
DEMONS.</h3>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_314">314</a>.&mdash;Old residents at Surat may remember an ancient local
celebrity named Tom the Barber, among whose recollections of
former days was a chronicle of a renowned duelist, who used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>345]</a></span>
amuse himself by shooting with his pistol, somewhat after the fashion
of the Pearl-shooter. The little tin can of hot water which Tom carried,
slung from his forefinger as he went his morning rounds, was a
favorite mark. So were the water-jars on the heads of the women as
they passed the duelist&rsquo;s house coming from the well; and great was
Tom&rsquo;s relief when an old woman, who could not be pacified by the
usual douceur for the loss of her jar and the shock of finding the
water stream down her back, appealed to the authorities and had
the duelist bound over to abstain in future from his dangerous
amusement.</p>

<p>So vivid were Tom&rsquo;s recollections of his own terrors that, after the
lapse of half a century, he could ill conceal his sense of the poetical
justice finally inflicted on his tormentor, who was killed in a duel
to which he provoked a young officer who had never before fired a
pistol.</p>

An instrument so called from its similarity to a tiger&rsquo;s claw. It consists of sharp
curved steel blades set on a bar, which fits by means of finger-rings to the inside of
the hand, so as to be concealed when the hand is closed, while the blades project at
right angles to the cross bar and palm when the hand is opened. It is struck as in
slapping or tearing with the claws.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
